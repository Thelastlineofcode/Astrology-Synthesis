# Legal Positioning & Compliance Guide

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the legal positioning strategy for the Personal Development Insights Tool to ensure EEOC compliance and minimize liability for employment discrimination lawsuits.

**Critical Positioning:** This tool is a **personal development and coaching facilitator**, NOT an assessment or evaluation system for employment decisions.

## Legal Context

### The Risk: Employment Discrimination

Personality tests used in hiring, promotion, or performance evaluation face legal scrutiny under:
- **Title VII of the Civil Rights Act** (1964)
- **EEOC Guidelines** on employee selection
- **Americans with Disabilities Act** (ADA)
- **Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act** (GINA)

**Recent Settlements:**
- CVS: $2.25M for personality test discrimination
- Best Buy: Settlement for pre-employment psychological testing
- Target: $2M for discrimination in hiring assessments

### The Safe Harbor: Personal Development Positioning

By explicitly positioning as personal development/coaching (NOT employment assessment), we avoid the EEOC scrutiny that applies to "employment tests."

## Legal Positioning Strategy

### 1. Explicit Disclaimers

**Required on ALL outputs:**

```
IMPORTANT: This tool is for personal development, coaching, and
wellness purposes only. It is NOT intended for and must NOT be
used for hiring, promotion, performance evaluation, or any
employment decisions. Misuse for employment decisions may violate
employment discrimination laws.
```

**Implementation:**
- Include in every API response
- Display prominently in UI
- Include in Terms of Service
- Include in customer contracts
- Train customer success team

### 2. Strategic Terminology

**Use This:**
- Personal development tool
- Coaching facilitator
- Self-awareness platform
- Wellness integration
- Team building activity
- Reflection tool
- Growth framework

**NEVER Use:**
- Assessment
- Evaluation
- Screening
- Selection tool
- Predictive indicator
- Performance measurement
- Hiring tool

### 3. Market Positioning

**Target:**
- Corporate wellness programs
- Executive coaching
- Team building workshops
- Leadership development
- Employee engagement initiatives

**Avoid:**
- Talent acquisition
- HR screening
- Performance management
- Succession planning (if tied to promotions)

## Key Findings

### 1. Code Development Agent Has Highest Workload
The Code Development Agent is assigned 5 out of 7 issues (71%). This is expected because:
- Most open issues involve frontend component implementation
- These are technical implementation tasks requiring coding expertise
- Issues can be tackled sequentially or parallelized across sprints

### 2. Critical Priority Issue Identified
- **Issue #18** (Modal Component) is marked P0-Critical
- This component is foundational and blocks other features
- Should be prioritized for immediate assignment

### 3. Specialized Work Properly Delegated
- **Issue #22** (BMAD Pattern Display) correctly assigned to BMAD Business & Development Suite
- This ensures domain expertise is applied to business logic
- Prevents incorrect implementation by generalist agents

### 4. Design Work Separated
- **Issue #17** (Dashboard Layout) assigned to Content Creation Agent
- Ensures professional UI/UX design before implementation
- Follows proper design → development workflow

## Recommended Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- **Start**: Issue #18 (Modal Component) - P0-Critical
- **Agent**: Code Development Agent
- **Goal**: Unblock dependent features

### Phase 2: Framework (Week 2)
- **Parallel Track A**: Issue #17 (Dashboard Layout)
  - **Agent**: Content Creation Agent
- **Parallel Track B**: Issue #22 (BMAD Pattern Display)
  - **Agent**: BMAD Business & Development Suite
- **Goal**: Establish visual framework and business logic

### Phase 3: Visualization (Week 3)
- **Start**: Issue #21 (Interactive Chart Canvas)
- **Agent**: Code Development Agent
- **Goal**: Complex visualization complete

### Phase 4: Data Display (Week 4)
- **Parallel**: Issues #23 & #24 (Planet & House Tables)
- **Agent**: Code Development Agent
- **Goal**: Complete standard data components

### Phase 5: Integration (Week 5)
- **Start**: Issue #25 (Symbolon Cards)
- **Agent**: Code Development Agent
- **Goal**: Final component integration

## Success Metrics

## 🎮 HOW TO EXECUTE (SIMPLE 3-STEP PATTERN)

### For Every Feature (Repeat 6 times):

**Step 1: You ask Copilot** (5 min)

```
Open VS Code
Open Copilot chat (Cmd+I on Mac, Ctrl+I on Windows)
Copy prompt from COPILOT_PROMPT_LIBRARY.md
Paste into chat
Hit enter
```

**Step 2: Copilot generates** (30-60 sec)

```
Copilot outputs complete code
Code is ready to use
```

**Step 3: You review + deploy** (30-60 min)

```
Copy generated code to project
Test locally (npm run dev or python3 -m uvicorn...)
Fix any issues (ask Copilot if stuck)
Deploy to Vercel/Railway
Test on production
Move to next feature
```

**Repeat 6 times** (Nov 5-15) → MVP shipped

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### You Must Do These Things

1. **Test every feature** before deploying
   - Launch app locally: `npm run dev` or `python3 -m uvicorn...`
   - Try the feature yourself
   - Verify it works as expected

2. **Review Copilot code** (5 min per feature)
   - Look for: password hashing, JWT validation, SQL injection risks
   - Look for: accessibility labels, error handling, loading states
   - If something looks wrong, ask Copilot to fix it

3. **Deploy weekly** (at least twice)
   - Saturday Nov 9: Deployment test run
   - Friday Nov 15: Production launch

4. **Gather user feedback** starting Nov 7
   - Share link with 50-100 beta users (astrology communities, friends)
   - Collect feedback via Google Form or Typeform
   - Use feedback to iterate

5. **Document blockers** if you get stuck
   - Write down what blocked you
   - Ask Perplexity or Copilot for help
   - Move forward (don't get stuck for >1 hour)

---

## 🆘 IF YOU GET STUCK

**1. Code not working?**

```
→ Ask Copilot: "This code has a bug. [describe bug]. Fix it."
→ Copilot regenerates just that part
→ Copy fixed code
→ Test again
```

**2. Architecture question?**

```
→ Ask Perplexity: "Best way to [do X] in [framework]?"
→ Perplexity: Research + recommendations
→ You: Decide which approach
→ Ask Copilot: "Implement [chosen approach]"
```

**3. Unsure if something's possible?**

```
→ Ask Perplexity: "Can I [do X] with [framework/API]? How?"
→ Perplexity: Shows feasibility + examples
```

**4. Stuck for >1 hour on same issue?**

```
→ Skip that feature, move to next one
→ Come back to blocker later (fresh eyes help)
→ Document the issue for next sprint
```

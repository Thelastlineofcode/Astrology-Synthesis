## 💡 KEY PRINCIPLES

### 1. Ship Fast

- MVP scope only (no gold-plating)
- 1-2 week sprints
- Daily deployments

### 2. Validate Early

- Real users in Week 1
- Revenue in Week 2
- Inform decisions with data

### 3. Scale Intentionally

- Build isolated first
- Merge when proven
- Foundation solid before new features

### 4. No Scope Creep

- Any new feature = future sprint
- Founder enforces MVP scope
- If we slip on time: cut scope, not quality

### 5. Transparent Communication

- Daily standup (no hiding)
- Weekly metrics review (numbers don't lie)
- Go/no-go gates (force decisions)

### 6. Team First

- Psychological safety (ask questions, admit blockers)
- Help teammates (don't hoard knowledge)
- Celebrate wins (every milestone celebrated)

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Auth must work** - Blocks everything
2. **Dasha accuracy must be verified** - Core credibility
3. **Database migration must be perfect** - Data loss = game over
4. **Performance must be acceptable** - <3s page load
5. **Team must stay aligned** - Daily standups non-negotiable
6. **Go/no-go gates must be respected** - Make hard decisions weekly
7. **Quality over speed** - Ship great, not first

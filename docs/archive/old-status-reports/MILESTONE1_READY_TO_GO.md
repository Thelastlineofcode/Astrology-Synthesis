## 💡 KEY PHILOSOPHY

**This is NOT**:

- Hiring expensive developers (costs $40-50K)
- Building alone without help (takes too long)
- Complex architecture (delays shipping)
- Manual code writing (bottleneck)

**This IS**:

- Solo founder + AI team (fast)
- Copilot generates code (saves 50% time)
- You make decisions (ensures quality)
- Daily shipping (incremental progress)
- Low cost (revenue-funded)

**Result**:

- Full MVP in 9 days
- $0 infrastructure cost
- $30-60/month AI subscriptions
- 40-50 hours your time
- ~200 hours AI generated
- Ready to scale

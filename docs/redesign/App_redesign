Complete App Redesign Plan: BMAD Astrology + Archetype System
1. Core App Flow & Feature Set Redesign
1.1 Redesigned Information Architecture
New Primary Navigation Structure:

text
Dashboard (Home) → Chart Analysis → Self-Discovery → Journal → Automation → Profile
     ↓               ↓              ↓           ↓         ↓          ↓
  Overview       Natal Chart    BMAD + Cards   Entries  Workflows  Settings
  Quick Actions  Transits       Archetypes     Analytics Triggers  Cultural
  Insights       Aspects        Growth Tools   Mood     Actions    Themes

 Chart Viewer: SVG-based interactive natal chart with cultural overlays

 Modal System: Drawer, dialog, and fullscreen variants with proper focus management

 Form Components: Inputs, selects, toggles with healing color palette and error states

Component Specifications:

jsx
// Example: Primary Card Component
<Card
  variant="insight|action|stat|feature"
  colorAccent="sage|indigo|lavender|terracotta"
  size="small|medium|large|full"
  interactive={boolean}
  elevation="low|medium|high"
>
  <CardHeader icon={Icon} title="String" />
  <CardContent>{children}</CardContent>
  <CardActions primary="String" secondary="String" />
</Card>
3.2 Navigation & Information Architecture Changes
From Current → To Redesigned:

Flat menu structure → Hierarchical with progressive disclosure

Feature-based navigation → User journey-based flow

Technical terminology → Human-centered language

Single cultural lens → Multicultural framework selector

New Settings Organization:

Personal: Profile, birth data, display preferences

Experience: Cultural framework, chart calculations, notification preferences

Accessibility: Theme, contrast, motion, text size

Privacy: Data export, account management

3.3 Data Flow & State Management Updates
State Architecture Changes:

User Preferences: Store cultural framework, theme, accessibility settings

Progress Tracking: Journal streaks, feature exploration, analysis completion

Personalization: Insight priorities, recommended actions, workflow triggers

Cultural Context: Dynamic terminology, symbol sets, interpretation frameworks

New API Endpoints Needed:

 Text Scaling: Interface remains functional at 200% zoom

Testing Requirements:

Automated accessibility audit integration

Manual testing with screen readers

Keyboard-only navigation validation

Color blindness simulation testing

3.5 Responsive Design Implementation
Breakpoint Strategy:

css
/* Mobile First Approach */
.dashboard-grid {
  grid-template-columns: 1fr; /* Mobile: single column */
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .dashboard-grid {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; /* Tablet: two columns */
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .dashboard-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); /* Desktop: three columns */
  }
}
Mobile-Specific Features:

Bottom navigation with 5 primary sections

Swipeable card carousels for Symbolon gallery

Collapsible content sections for detailed analysis

Pull-to-refresh on dashboard and journal list

Bottom sheet modals instead of center dialogs

Immediate UI updates with appropriate terminology

Chart interpretations use cultural context

Symbolon cards include cultural connections where relevant

Framework can be changed anytime with smooth transitions

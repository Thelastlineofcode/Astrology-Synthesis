# Agent Deployment - Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Ready to Deploy Agents!

All setup is complete. Here's how to begin:

---

## ‚úÖ Current Status

**Issue #10 (CSS Variables)** - Agent already assigned ‚úÖ  
Waiting for PR to be created (~30-60 minutes)

**Remaining 15 issues** - Ready to deploy sequentially and in parallel

---

## üìã Deployment Options

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

Run the deployment script:

\`\`\`bash
cd /workspaces/Astrology-Synthesis/docs/redesign/github-project
./deploy-all-agents.sh
\`\`\`

**What it does:**
- Checks foundation status (#10-13)
- Assigns Agent 1 to next foundation issue when ready
- Once foundation complete, deploys all 6 agents in parallel
- Provides progress monitoring commands

### Option 2: Manual Sequential Deployment

Assign agents one at a time as issues complete:

\`\`\`bash
# After #10 merges, assign #11:
gh issue comment 11 --body "@agent-1 #github-pull-request_copilot-coding-agent [See DETAILED_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md for full instructions]"

# After #11 merges, assign #12, etc.
\`\`\`

### Option 3: Monitor and React

Wait for Issue #10 PR, review it, merge it, then run deployment script.

---

## üéØ Recommended Workflow (START HERE)

### Step 1: Monitor Issue #10

\`\`\`bash
# Check if PR has been created
gh pr list --state open

# View the PR when it appears
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER>

# Checkout PR locally to test
gh pr checkout <PR_NUMBER>
cd frontend && npm start

# Test theme toggle in browser
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Review & Merge PR #10

\`\`\`bash
# If tests pass and looks good:
gh pr review <PR_NUMBER> --approve --body "LGTM! CSS variables and theme toggle working perfectly."

# Merge the PR
gh pr merge <PR_NUMBER> --squash

# Or merge via GitHub web UI
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Deploy Next Phase

\`\`\`bash
# Run deployment script to assign Agent 1 to Issue #11
./deploy-all-agents.sh

# Script will check status and assign next appropriate issue
\`\`\`

### Step 4: Repeat for Foundation

Continue reviewing and merging PRs as Agent 1 completes:
- #11 (Typography) ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Merge ‚Üí Script assigns #12
- #12 (Buttons) ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Merge ‚Üí Script assigns #13  
- #13 (Cards) ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Merge ‚Üí Foundation complete!

### Step 5: Deploy All Parallel Agents

Once foundation complete (#10-13 all merged):

\`\`\`bash
# Run script - it will detect foundation complete and deploy ALL agents
./deploy-all-agents.sh

# This assigns:
# - Agent 2: Forms (#14, #20)
# - Agent 3: UI Feedback (#15, #18, #19)
# - Agent 4: Navigation (#16, #17)
# - Agent 5: Charts (#21, #23)
# - Agent 6: BMAD (#22)
# - Agent 7: Symbolon (#24, #25)
\`\`\`

### Step 6: Monitor All PRs

\`\`\`bash
# View all open PRs
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,author,createdAt

# Daily standup - check progress
gh issue list --milestone "Milestone 1: Foundation"
gh issue list --milestone "Milestone 2: Core Features"

# Review PRs as they come in
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER>
gh pr checkout <PR_NUMBER>  # Test locally
gh pr review <PR_NUMBER> --approve
gh pr merge <PR_NUMBER> --squash
\`\`\`

---

## üìä Monitoring Commands

### Check Agent Progress

\`\`\`bash
# See all open PRs from agents
gh pr list --state open

# Check specific issue status
gh issue view 10 --comments

# See what's merged today
gh pr list --state merged --search "merged:>=2025-10-28"

# View milestone progress
gh issue list --milestone "Milestone 1: Foundation" --json number,title,state
\`\`\`

### Track Specific Agent

\`\`\`bash
# Find PRs by issue number
gh pr list --search "Implement Typography #11"

# View PR details
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json title,body,state,mergeable,reviews
\`\`\`

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Agent Hasn't Created PR After 2 Hours

\`\`\`bash
# Check if agent received the comment
gh issue view <ISSUE_NUMBER> --comments

# Look for any error messages
gh issue view <ISSUE_NUMBER> --json comments --jq '.comments[].body'

# Try re-assigning
gh issue comment <ISSUE_NUMBER> --body "#github-pull-request_copilot-coding-agent Please implement this issue following all acceptance criteria."
\`\`\`

### PR Has Merge Conflicts

\`\`\`bash
# Checkout PR
gh pr checkout <PR_NUMBER>

# Rebase on latest master
git fetch origin master
git rebase origin/master

# Resolve conflicts, then:
git add .
git rebase --continue
git push --force-with-lease
\`\`\`

### Tests Failing

\`\`\`bash
# Run tests locally
cd frontend
npm test

# Fix issues, commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix failing tests"
git push

# Or request agent to fix:
# Comment on PR: "@github-copilot The tests are failing with error: [error message]. Please fix."

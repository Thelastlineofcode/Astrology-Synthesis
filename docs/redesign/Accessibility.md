## Color Accessibility Compliance

### Contrast Requirements Met
- **Primary Text**: Gold/copper accents on dark navy backgrounds exceed WCAG 2.1 AA standards (4.5:1 ratio)
- **Secondary Elements**: Silver accents maintain sufficient contrast for visibility
- **Gradient Usage**: Deep navy to black gradients preserve readability across all logo variants

### Visual Accessibility Features
- **High Contrast**: Dark background with bright metallic accents ensures visibility for users with visual impairments

- **Symbolic Clarity**: Mystical elements designed with sufficient weight and contrast

## Inclusive Design Considerations

### Cultural Sensitivity
- **Vodou Representation**: Spiritual elements incorporated respectfully without stereotyping

## 🚨 CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS

### Challenge: "Won't Copilot code be low quality?"

**Solution**:

- Review every generated function
- Run tests immediately
- Refactor as needed
- Quality > speed initially
- You're still the engineer, Copilot is the assistant

### Challenge: "I'll get stuck on architecture decisions"

**Solution**:

- Use Perplexity to research patterns
- Ask Copilot to generate options ("Show 2 ways to do X")
- Your judgment decides which is right
- Better to iterate than to spend weeks perfecting

### Challenge: "AI won't understand domain knowledge (astrology)"

**Solution**:

- You do the astrology logic/research
- Copilot does the implementation
- Perplexity helps with astro research if needed
- Example: You design algorithm, Copilot codes it

### Challenge: "I'll burn out working alone"

**Solution**:

- Work 40-50 hrs/week max, not 80
- Take weekends off
- Use AI to reduce tedious parts (testing, boilerplate)
- Set realistic weekly goals
- Ship every 2 weeks minimum (celebration point)

The Warrior
(Aries / Mars)
Aggression; Capacity to Achieve; Conquest; Instigator;Phallic Power; Energy of a New Beginning

@@a)
Underlying the problem is the anger and aggression you havenot yet perceived and acknowledged. What has happened tothis persona? Why do you hide its feelings? Perhaps youthink they are inappropriate, that you are too refined andeverything must be governed by reason. Or perhaps you don'twant to confront your own cowardice.

@@b)
The task ahead of you involved becoming more instigative.You are being asked to act in order to unravel the Gordianknot holding you captive. You won't progress any furtherwithout acquiring the resolve to act.

@@c)
You regain your ability to act. You have the strength toregenerate (now). The conclusion of the process heralds anabsolute new beginning in which you gather strength and thewarrior in you can embark upon a new round in the game oflife.

The Lover
(Taurus / Venus)
Worth; Attraction; Possession; Sociability; PhysicalAttraction

@@a)
You are a prisoner of your own feelings of worthlessnessdeep down inside. This under-estimation of your self (thewords "I don't like myself") must be allowed to come to thesurface. It's no longer enough to use other people's labelsor seek their attention in regard to whether they stilllike you or can be won over (will go to bed with you.)

@@b)
As much as esoteric circles propagate "letting go" of bodyand matter, your path ahead involves thinking about Venus.That means becoming her friend. Learn to see life as asensual experience and to respect the value your body asthe residence of the soul without exaggerating itsimportance or wasting your energy.

@@c)
Your path has led you to gather self-esteem. You havelearned to judge things realistically and to see them forwhat they are: material things.

The Mediator
(Gemini / Mercury)
The Messenger (of the Gods); Intellect; Contact; TheOnlooker; Ease

@@a)
You are unhappy with your position in life at the moment.You find it too boring, banal, superficial. You don't wantto identify with the meaning and demands of Mercury; youhave blocked and dispelled the messenger. You have lost hiswings -- his lightness.

@@b)
Mercury offers his help in leading you to a solution. Hismessage reads: "Give yourself some distance and take aquiet look at your present situation, speak your truefeelings and face matters with a detached and objectiveattitude."

@@c)
Regardless of how difficult the road may be, you will beable to use "Hermes wings" to unite the unconscious withthe conscious and then observe yourself from a neutralposition -- in hindsight, maybe even with mischievous smile.

@4
The Mother
(Cancer / Moon)
Femininity; The Family; The Infant; Feelings; Devotion;Acceptance; The Spiritual Past

@@a)
Your feelings -- the waters of your soul -- are being driedup by the inner child which says "NO" and the "NO" whichcloses off your inner being. You are frightened of feelingyour own self, scared of your feminine aspect and thepowerlessness it might generate.

@@b)
This card clearly advises you to follow the path of yourfeelings. Discard reason for a moment and act intuitively.Look for the child within and let this child live andexpress itself.

@@c)
Your journey will lead you to embrace the inner child andlive in harmony. You reach a homeland of your own, returnhome to your feelings and your feminine aspect. You findsecurity in yourself.

@5
The Ego
(Leo / Sun)
Power; Desire; Uniqueness; Glory; Fertility; Creativity;Sexuality

@@z)
In you for the moment a lack of aliveness exists. You lostthe entrance to your Kraft. Where did the life remain? Youmust begin, your identity, yours be, to express. At the endof this enterprise you live. Kraft, which to aliveness,those you miss for the moment, return a little more to you.The sun goes, a new day begins. You are then also againwith the heart with the thing.

@@a)
You lack vitality, joy, and a necessary form ofhard-heartedness deep down. This means you cannot put yourenergies to use. You might be trying to compensate for yourimpotence and lack of power through dominant behaviour. Youneed to ask yourself where you can still find life.

@@b)
The path ahead involves learning to express yourself, youridentity and your being. You need to live the way YOU are,even if this hurts others. All this may not be as easy asit sounds: just live your life!

@@c)
Your path leads you back to life. Strength and vitality --perhaps lacking at the moment -- return to you. You putyour heart and soul back into things.

@6
The Servant
(Virgo / Mercury)
Reason; Accepting Reality; Rationality; Sobriety; SpiritualBalance

@@a)
This card says you refuse to accept your current positionin life. You like to keep a clean image by blaming others,leading you to become caught up in your own projections.But the finger ultimately points back at you.

@@b)
It's no use now: although it's a bitter pill to swallow,you have to accept yourself; set your sights lower andadjust to the conditions of life.

@@c)
The result of your learning process is not the gold at theend of the rainbow, but quiet, unprepossessing order and aknowledge through which your soul finds composure andresumes its rightful place.

@7
The Partner
(Libra / Venus)
The Other; The Relationship; Balance; The Symbolon; TheMirror; Supplementation; "The Better Half"

@@a)
You are not yet prepared to look into the mirror of theother and recognize what you see there as part of yourself.You refuse to understand that the other is only expressingyour own otherness.

@@b)
The path involves learning to understand yourself inothers. This means mutual exchange and offering your handto the other in reconciliation (or understanding). It isvital to meet someone along the way who opens your eyes.

@@c)
You have rediscovered yourself in the other, found balanceand harmony between the inner and external partners. Nowthe symbolon has been reunited. The pieces have been puttogether.

@8
The Seducer
(Scorpio / Pluto)
The Devil, The Imagination; The Idea; Suicide; Obligation;Fixation; Fanaticism; The Underworld

@@a)
You have become obsessed with an idea; now you are stuck.You therefore give away part of your soul in the hope ofreceiving something better. You are ruled by underworldforces; you are gambling with the Devil. Find out what ideait is you're obsessed with at the moment. Do nothing moreand nothing less than you need to.

@@b)
You can only reach the light at the end of the tunnel bytackling the landscape of the underworld and crossing it.Nothing more can be done; nor can it be "bettered" (avoidlooking for improvements -- that's one of his favoriteideas). Only Virgil's words can help you now: "Look closelyand go on!"

@@c)
A metamorphosis will take place. Old images must beshattered, just as Moses destroyed the Golden Calf longago. These images will ultimately dissolve like a morningfog in sunlight (because they never really existed!).

@9
The Preacher
(Sagittarius / Jupiter)
The Priest; The Missionary; The Inner Therapist; Belief;Insight; Philosophical View of the World

@@a)
Where is your sympathy, the memory of your own spiritualpast? You presume to impose your opinions and knowledgeupon others while your own soul remains infertile.

@@b)
Remember! That's what this card tells you to do. Look foran inner therapist (a person, if need be, who acts as amirror). And above all, retrace your steps. Solutions canonly be found in your past.

@@c)
You will continue to grow, to become more open-minded andtolerant. Mnemosyne, the Goddess of memory, has a treasurewaiting for you at the end of the journey: insight is thewealth of the soul.

@10
The Master
(Capricorn / Saturn)
Legitimacy; Responsibility; Fate; The Old Man; Death; TheMerciless Taskmaster

@@a)
You have become hard, retreated into a shell where no onecan communicate with you or reach your soul. It is as ifyou have withdrawn to a fortress of loneliness high in themountains. The fortress is part of you. Take a close lookand try to accept responsibility for having built it.

@@b)
The way through the problem is to learn to take life'sgravity into account. The game's over -- now you have toconfront your problems honestly. It's all about becoming an"adult".

@@c)
The outcome is that you now realize an objective destinyprevails over you, a power (the power of fate) no one caninfluence, one you accept and acknowledge. Now you areresponsible for yourself. That means responding andaccepting responsibility with a firm "yes".

@11
The Jester
(Aquarius / Uranus)
Deliverer; Freedom; The Outsider; The "True" Hero;Steppenwolf

@@a)
You have forgotten the original meaning of the world"freedom". You might believe you need to escape the prisonof your situation in life, but you shake helplessly, invain, at the bars of external conditions. You don'tunderstand the real message of The Jester: human beingshave to work on every opportunity, every spiritual path, inorder to grow from a situation.

@@b)
Try to find spiritual space beyond your presentcomplications. The path to freedom involves nothing morethan release, letting go of your current problem -- even ifthis now seems paradoxical. Try to come in contact withyour own Jester and learn to laugh at yourself.

@@c)
Conditions have catapulted you out of outdated andsuperseded ways of approaching things. Your path ofdevelopment has given you wings -- and you didn't evennotice it. So fly!

@12
The Angel
(Pisces / Neptune)
The Truth; The Divine Spark; Wisdom; Intuition; The Dream;The Illusion

@@a)
You have lost your way. Your view of truth has becomeclouded by illusions. You hide from yourself and fall foryour own tricks. You try to repress and avoid problems, youshy away from facing reality. You are nowhere near solvingthe problem and there is still a long way to go before youbeing to deal with it.

@@b)
You need to take the word "release" quite literally.Release yourself from the outer world, be morecontemplative and look within yourself. Your problem has nobearing in the world outside. You can only look moreclosely at yourself.

@@c)
At first you don't recognize the end of your journey as itis invisible in the outer world. But the star of a learnedtruth will illuminate within your soul.

@13
Defiance
(Cancer / Aries, Moon / Mars)
The Destructive Child; Rage; "Runaway Johnny"; SeethingAnger; Hatred for the Mother; Rejection of Femininity

@@a)
Your belly aches because a little child within you isthrowing a tantrum, beating its fists angrily against thedepths of your soul and crying to get out. The whole worldis "evil", it plots against you. Accept that you are asmall child at the moment and still a long way from being asensible adult.

@@b)
Years and years of anger want to be let out. First of all,you will have to go through a painful labor which bringsthe deepest part of yourself into the world. Your energieswill not begin to flow again unless the pent-up anger canbe released and experienced. Find your own (perhapstherapeutic) terms by which it becomes possible to freelyexpress your rage without hurting other people.

@@c)
It is only possible to be at peace with the "little tyrant"once we have lived out our childhood, those feelings ofdefiance, anger and annoyance. One day you will have toembrace the child.

@14
The Two Faces of Eve
(Cancer / Taurus, Moon / Venus)
Role Conflict; Ambivalent Feelings; Two Souls Within OneBody; Wife and Lover

@@a)
You face a difficult decision, you can't make up your mind.A sacrifice is called for one way or the other, and thissacrifice is too great. So you remain hesitant. That's theheart of the matter. Two souls are living within thefeminine aspect of your breast. Do you want to be mother orlover (or for a man: have a mother or a lover)? A decisiononly serves to repress the problem. The card urges you toacknowledge your indecision. Nothing more!

@@b)
Your path should lead you to identify two conflicting and-- on the whole -- mutually intolerant forms withinyourself. Each one says "take me!". In essence, this meansyou are unable to perform the role of any single one.

@@c)
You discover ultimately that both aspects deserve a placein your soul; both have their time and place, they feelclose to you but not to each other. You accept the distancethey keep from one another.

@15
Articulation
(Cancer / Gemini, Moon / Mercury)
Discussing Feelings; Psychotherapy (Psychoanalysis); MakingContact with Feelings; The Connection Between Mind and"Belly"

@@a)
You prefer to remain on the surface and ignore yourfeelings. You do everything to avoid perceiving or havingto express them. But you have known for a long time whatneeds to be addressed. You need to understand thatunexpressed feelings prey on the mind and, by their verynature, can trigger off illness.

@@b)
The time has come to express what's happening in your lifeand what you feel. There's no progress without discussion-- only backsliding. Find a friend to talk to, or apsychologist if no one is prepared to listen.

@@c)
Reason and instinct come in contact with one another. Youneither let yourself to be terrorized by feelings (andterrorize others) nor allow them to be silenced. You canexpress them as they arise. And you don't need to make abig thing of them; they are not that important.

@16
Incompatibility
(Cancer / Leo, Moon / Sun)
Expulsion from Paradise; The Double; Marriage; Day andNight; Yin and Yang

@@a)
The heart of the matter is a failure to understand theincompatibility between man and woman. As a man you do notunderstand the "woman in you"; as a woman you do notunderstand the "man in you". Try to see things from theother's perspective for a change.

@@b)
Your path takes you through a phase where it becomesnecessary to devote more attention to the neglected aspectof your self than you have already done (you know bestwhich part that is). You have to demand acceptance of yourfemininity from your masculine aspect, or vice versa.

@@c)
The path has led to both aspects having equal importance.Although this alone cannot resolve their incompatibility,you are aware of both sides now and value each accordingly.You have an inkling of what Paradise is, and that moment ofmutual recognition (at the beginning and end of the day)causes your heart to beat a little faster.

@17
Caring
(Cancer / Virgo, Moon / Mercury)
Sympathy; Watching over Someone; Caring; Grief; The ProblemChild; Helper Syndrome

@@a)
You have forgotten there is someone dependent on yoursympathy and care. The one waiting for you to care for himor her in the world outside only mirrors the small childwithin who wants attention.

@@b)
Take care of yourself. Look after your own emotionalwell-being. Don't allow yourself to be distracted byothers' feelings. The small child in you is crying andseeks attention.

@@c)
The mother/child relationship has been restored within you.You don't feel so frightened, nor so helpless and at themercy of others now that you have learned to look afteryourself.

@18
The Family
(Cancer / Libra, Moon / Venus)
The Third Force; Spiritual Contact; "WE"; Confession to aRelationship; Compound; Cohesion

@@a)
You have contributed to the creation of a third force butrefuse to become involved. You refuse to accept itspiritually, choosing to give the third force over foradoption instead.

@@b)
The way through the problem will demand a confession. But aconfession means spiritually accepting something moretroublesome because the generation of a third forcepresents its own challenges.

@@c)
A common entity will arise, a third force which is greaterthan its individual components. Rather than belong to you,it has a life of its own which needs both adults for awhile to nourish its spiritual energies and allow it togrow.

@19
Abortion
(Cancer / Scorpio, Moon / Pluto)
Selling the Soul; Sacrificed Femininity; ImaginingFeelings; Spiritual Dependence; Depression; Concept ofMotherhood

@@a)
The God of the Underworld has you firmly in his clutches.You have sacrificed your soul to the enemy of the livingand now seek comfort in others. You cling to the hope thatsomeone can free you from darkness. The path that leads youto light is long -- you must first descend into the depths,into the world of the shadow, before you find your way backto the living.

@@b)
You have to descent into the underworld with your feelings,just as Persephone did before you. That's where you franklyadmit that it will take all you have before you can buyback your feelings and surface from the depths.

@@c)
You have sacrificed a lot: images and imagined feelingswhich were surrogates and self-delusions. A lot had to be"torn from your soul". The wounds will hurt for a long timebut now you have more freedom and independence. You are nolonger bound by what you have sacrificed; it has no powerover you any more.

@20
Mnemosyne
(Cancer / Sagittarius, Moon / Jupiter)
Memory; Therapy; Insight into the Soul; Personal Truth; TheMuses

@@a)
The waters of Lethe flow through your soul, leaving nochance to remember. You deny the (feminine) healer withinyou and suffer from a spell of forgetting. Daylight fadesaround you. But Mnemosyne would like to make contact withyou, let you know that your problem can only be solved byremembering.

@@b)
Therapy of one form or another will be needed to help youget through the problem. It does not have to be in the formof a (paid) "worldly" therapist, although this would alsobe useful.

@@c)
As difficult as it was, the process has given you animportant insight. That's what it was all about: youdescended and remembered.

@21
The Ice Queen
(Cancer / Capricorn, Moon / Saturn)
Hardened Femininity; The Lonely Child; The Strict Mother;Feelings of Guilt; Depression

@@a)
The underlying cause of your problem is an inner personawhich has closed off its feelings. You have curled up likea hedgehog, built a wall around your feelings ("a shell"),and now your reactions are cold and distant. The task is totake responsibility for your hardness instead ofattributing it to the world.

@@b)
It's time to be more adult. You might ask what is left ofall your tears. The feminine aspect of your self can onlysurface if you deal with tears arising from loss or hurtfeelings (not to be confused with tears of self-pity --they're easy to come by).

@@c)
Your path leads you to take more responsibility for yourown insensitive feelings. Then you stop blaming otherpeople for your own callousness. It comes from you! Onlythis knowledge can bring about a thaw.

@22
Deliverance
(Cancer / Aquarius, Moon / Uranus)
Emotional Release; Leaving Childhood Behind; Cold Freedom;Insecurity; Exile from the Homeland

@@a)
You don't want to accept the passing of a secure phase.Growth is long overdue and it is high time you hatched fromthe egg. The protective shell may well have to be brokenopen from outside because you are too frightened to chooseto leave narrow boundaries.

@@b)
You already know that the shell has deep cracks, that youneed to give birth to something new. A certain theme inyour life has aged. Your path involves pecking away theremaining pieces of the shell, and that takes a lot ofstrength and hard work -- but you know there is no turningback now.

@@c)
You've hatched from the shell -- it's cold outside. But youknow it is all part of becoming an adult. Time will giveyou strength; the soul will grow its "feathers". And this,according to Plato, is the most important thing that canhappen.

Sleeping Beauty-Slumber
(Cancer / Pisces, Moon / Neptune)
The Dream; Longing; The Unborn; The Bewitched Soul;Intuition; Woman in the Realm of Oblivion; Waiting

@@a)
You are homeless, insecure and expectant. A wave of longingis unleashed in you and there is no one who can really easeit. This might be a sweet kind of pain, but it is alsodeeply disturbing because you hide yourself away. Feelingslike these cannot be changed -- they can only be endured.

@@b)
It's true that you feel lonely, but you also realize howthe heavens can only address you in homelessness. Look atyour dreams (take flights of fancy) so you can feel themessages inside you more clearly. If you keep lookingoutside yourself, the search will be in vain.

@@c)
You discover a more profound, invisible world next to thevisible one, and there you will find a guide. For the sakeof "intuition", this guide will show you the miracles ofthe objective world and let you forget your loneliness.

The Battle
(Leo / Aries, Sun / Mars)
Power Struggle; Victory of Pyrrhus; Self-annihilation; An"Own-Goal"; Shadow-Boxing

@@a)
You have become tangled up in your own aggressions. Youbelieve you have identified the enemy in the world outside,and now, despairing, seek victory whilst failing to realizeyou are fighting yourself. You are your own worst enemy.The more vehemently you try to win, the more energy youwaste -- ultimately, it leads to self-annihilation.

@@b)
The task ahead is to seize territory and win ground foryourself. No one is going to just hand it over. It's atooth and nail battle. There is something to be learned,even from close victory or defeat: a little courage and youwill learn how to face up to your opponents and fight.

@@c)
You have discovered that an outside enemy is only ever areflection of an inner persona and a part of yourself. Thatdoesn't mean, however, that you should not take up armswhen need be: it's up to you to decide whether or not tofight.

Feminine Power and Strength; Grandeur and Splendor; TheQueen; Using Sensuality and Erotic Charm

@@a)
You alienated yourself from your ego; it can only be (orhas been) reached by means of other people. You areprepared to "sell out" by clinging to someone whose powerand strength you suppose will help you. Your intrinsicsense of self-esteem lacks foundation.

@@b)
You have to learn to use your own charms to achieve whatyou want now. Try to view charm and the powers ofattraction as part of a game you play, things you use tohelp satisfy desired and achieve your aims. The ego game isone we all play -- there's scarcely any other.

@@c)
You have realized you're not a sovereign Queen but someonewho is dependent on others -- and that includes yoursubjects. You use your position in a friendly and loyalmanner, without false modesty, and without feeling the needto hide your borrowed feathers.

The Actor
(Leo / Gemini, Sun / Mercury)
The Role; Self-portrayal; The Assumed Identity; "Theater";Stage Backdrop; Intellectualism

@@a)
You fail to understand that you only act a role in presentsituation. The real person is hidden behind the "role"; itmay be a while before you accept responsibility for it. Forthe time being, it's enough to know that your importance isborrowed or acted out. Of course, you are afraid of someoneremoving the mask. But who exactly could be revealed?

@@b)
Play the role. Walk on-stage and start acting. Don't beconcerned if the character isn't really you. The stage isyour world now -- so act as well as you can. Does all thissound a bit false? Don't let it bother you. This is whatyour path demands. Only take yourself as seriously as therole asks of you.

Attraction of the Sexes; Sex; Flirtation; Body Contact;"Cher-Chez La Femme"

@@a)
The card would like to remind you of the theme (andproblem) of your sexuality. It wants to tell you: "Humanbeings can't live from the spirit alone; we have a bodytoo". It can mean two things: either this theme was allowedto run on so long that you have dried up, or you focus onnothing but the theme itself and have become closed toeverything else (surely you know which one is true). Inboth cases the car says: "Take more care of yoursexuality". Cupid is finding its target.

The way ahead involves finding the courage to be sensualagain, learning to understand your own inhibitions (orexcesses) and discovering that Amor has its own way ofuniting the pieces.

You are about to propagate a vicious lie or become thevictim of lies yourself. Neither of these -- whether youare victim or culprit -- is any more noble than the otheras both show you are susceptible to gossip and lies, thatyou have not understood the whole meaning. Whatever thecase, you believe you are not implicated in it beingspread. That's a mistake!

Your journey will not spare you the ignominy of the stocks.Your actions will be made public and it would be a goodthing to prepare yourself -- yes, even help the processalong (if you don't find it too difficult). Otherwise youwill be taken by surprise. The easiest way is to go public.That's what we call "outing".

You don't want to perceive a relationship conflict. Thatcould mean a conflict with your partner, a neighbor, friendor family member. You are afraid to argue and clash. Yourpartner, placed in the position of having to enact youraggressions, has become your enemy. This pressure -- whichyou want to repress with counter-pressure -- could just aseasily surface on the bodily plane (as cramps, pain, fever,or agitation).

@@b)
The one and only thing you can do is remove the bone ofcontention. You can only progress through open discussion.This path offers you very little harmony in therelationship.

@@c)
You have learned to live with the irreconcilable differencebetween the sexes. If you follow your ego's power to assertitself, you will inevitably lose the "we". If you give into togetherness, you will sacrifice a part of yourself. Youcan't have your cake and eat it too.

Penetration of the Soul; Rape; Bondage; The Victim; The"Undead"

@@a)
Part of you has died. This means you have attached yourselfto someone else, chosen this person as your perpetrator,and may now consider yourself to be a victim.

Now both of you are embroiled in "DangerousLiaisons"

@@a)
You act against your own good judgement (repress theinsights you have gained) and turn your sword on those who(you think) dissent. You want your "correct" opinions toprevail, not noticing that they are only the pretence towage war and destroy.

@@b)
Sometime you will have to stand up for your convictions,even if that means a fight. It is not enough just toachieve insight and knowledge if you are not prepared toback them with deeds.

@@c)
Ultimately, your actions are guided by insight andunderstanding. Deeds are no longer dictated by blindaggression; your well-thought out actions are driven byconviction. Now you know how easy it is to start a fight --shadow-box -- with yourself.

As part of this process you have to learn to rejectcompetitiveness and fighting. The task is to take aninconspicuous, independent path without seeking theconfirmation of others.

@@a)
Deep down you feel inferior. You suffer from lowself-esteem because you think someone either makes youappear plain and inadequate or that this is how you reallyare. Both suggest you get hung up on making comparisons(competition), something that can only make you lose in thelong term. As long as you try to increase your self-esteemby appearing attractive, you will remain a prisoner on theplane of self-portrayal -- in essence, you don't believe inyourself. You feel inferior.

@@b)
An essential part of the journey is to take a good look atyour competitive behavior. How or in regard to what persondo you dress yourself up to appear better than you reallyare? Take an honest look at how your lack of self-esteemsurfaces.

@@c)
When the problem is over you see that portrayingself-esteem is just a theatrical role. It is up to you todecide whether you continue the role or bid it farewell.Neither one is of great consequence, no matter what youdecide.

Clinging
(Taurus / Virgo, Venus / Mercury)
Greed; Gaining Weight; The Material World as ProtectiveWall and Prison; Assurance as Safeguard

@@a)
At some point you built a wall around yourself and, seekingsecurity (and in fear), became your own incarcerated slave."Excess" plays an important role here. You think, "Themore, the better", but this will only make you lessflexible and trap you even more in the end.

@@b)
Look at how you hope to find support in external valueswhich may later become obstacles and make progress moredifficult.

The Relationship as Imprisonment; The Partner asPossession; Jealousy; Bribing Your Partner; Devotion

@@a)
"Buying" and "being bought" are bitter aspects in yourrelationship. Relationships of this kind are doomed to"possession" and "jealousy". You are trapped no matterwhether you are the "possessor" or the "possessed". You arethe prisoner of the gilded cage who grows more passive andless flexible over time. You paid a high price for"security".

@@b)
The task at hand is to make your relationship (orfriendship) more meaningful. You have to "invest" in it andaccept a possible loss of freedom. Otherwise it willcontinue to lack the foundation and the fertile soil togrow.

@@c)
The journey leads you to a realization that the door of thecage was never closed. Two people who belong together andprovide warmth for one another should not isolatethemselves in "mutual reassurance". Devotion is a naturalpart of a relationship only when mutual growth anddevelopment are possible. But loss of freedom might be theprice to pay.

@@a)
You hang by invisible threads. You don't realize you aretrying to conform to an image. Expressed metaphorically,you want to become a larva. The God of the Underworldseduces you so perfectly that you are unable to distinguishbetween image and reality. It's like a virus with such along incubation period that you don't remember where andwhen you were infected.

@@b)
Try to find out how this alien virus turned you into adoll. The task is to escape, to emerge from the chrysalisand get back to your true individuality. This isn't easy asthere is always the risk of moving on to another image(unwittingly) after metamorphosis.

Spirit as Function; "New Age" Business (The Spiritual asProduct); Buying Your Happiness; The Sect

@@a)
You are about to buy important insights (or sell them tosomeone else). That means the spiritual property which youcarry around does not really belong to you. It has not yetbegun the journey through the soul. What you possess isstill a piece of merchandise you like to use as decorationfor the ego.

@@b)
New insights usually involve having to let go of something(valuable) which was either trapped within you or kept youyourself captive. The journey demands a sacrifice, and thissacrifice is something material.

@@c)
You know that your own insights (spiritual creations) areonly true for you. No one can buy them, and nor can they besold to anyone else. They like to be self-styled;"handmade", so to speak.

@@a)
There is a creature in your immediate environment (ananimal, a plant or even someone in need) which is weak andsomehow dependent on you. You are careless, you don'trealize this lifeform will wither and die unless itreceives attention. The task ahead of you is to care forit, look after it.

@@b)
You are being asked to intervene on behalf of someone else,the world or the environment. Your journey involveslearning to accept responsibility for the weak (lifeformswhich depend on you). That could mean an animal, plant orhuman being in need of your protection. Your journey willnever end unless you care for them and relieve their burden.

@@a)
You would like to remain in the protective shell of yoursurroundings but some aspect of your life has become too"hard". There is a danger of your roots driving down sodeep that you can never find the strength again to freeyourself. That's why fate has ordained deportation. Itassists in your passage to freedom and personal growth.

@@b)
You will have to give up your security or perhaps even yourfriends (or important groups of people). Certainaffiliations and aspects of your life have become tooantiquated to support you; there is nothing more you canlearn from them.

You have drifted unwittingly into a reverie. You flee fromreality by waiting for your dream to be realized. Thesekinds of dreams are like a drug, alienating you all themore from the world and those you find difficult to leave.They have lulled you into a false sense of reality. Aboveall else, they make you passive.

@@b)
The important step in your development is to embark on ajourney at some point which takes you away from yourhomeland. Material things are too restrictive, so thatmeans freeing yourself of most of your belongings. You canonly dream with such an enormous millstone about your neck.

Your relationship (or the relationship you seek) is hollowand empty at the moment because it is an ego-wish. Eitheryou have become someone's "ornament" or you use yourpartner to inflate your own ego. Instead of achieving deeptogetherness in your relationship, you find boredom anddisinterest which you try to overcome with "games".

Your partnership is going through a very ordinary,unremarkable phase: no highs, no lows. You are both simplyco-existing. It's the only way to solve your problem at themoment. This way, you might create the peace and quiet youneed to unwind and relax, give yourself the distance youneed to be more objective.

It is impossible to avoid being attracted by the sounds ofthe flute, even if they become empty promises. The more youfind out about life and what's best for you, the less oftenyou will fall for seduction in the future.

You have become a spiritual "medium". You impart and acceptknowledge according to need and your designated group. Youcan do both now.

You suffer from the spell of a (perhaps mild) compulsiveimage. You are trapped somehow in a vicious circle ofcompulsive "innocence and cleanliness". You think you canward off evil -- in thought or deed -- with constantself-purification. These rituals are occasionally so subtleand self-fulfilling that you consider them as part ofeveryday life. But they in fact rob you of an importantelement of your lifeforce and control you unconsciously,just like a puppet on a string.

There are times in the life of every human being when it isnecessary to forego desires in order to serve a higherideal. The path ahead involves submitting to the ideal.

Of course, hehas clothed himself in a wonderful coat of lights andproclaimed your work, your guru and the new relationship tobe noble, holy and God-fearing. but he is only dangling acarrot in front of your nose so that you will trot along inhis direction. You therefore don't realize that aneagerness to do Good has left you at his mercy.

@@b)
Your path leads you through a painful learning process: inshort, that "thou shalt not create an image". Every image,noble as it might be, is balsam for your ego and poison foryour soul. Now is the time to get to work on your shadowand remove the mask from images and ideas.

@@c)
You will understand that there is no light without itsshadow "darkness", that no darkness can exist without theshadow of light. It's time to stop being so biased as yousee one in the many and many in one.

Confession
(Sagittarius / Capricorn, Jupiter / Saturn)
Confession; Purification of the Subjective; Therapist'sResponsibility (The Priest); Insight into Destiny; TheBridge Between Subjectivity and Objectivity

@@a)
Your soul carries a burden which needs to be acknowledgedin the world outside. You have to confess. But do you thinkthis would only diminish your greatness? You're absolutelyright. Others will notice that you are not as enlightenedas you would have liked them to believe.

@@b)
It's not enough just to talk about guilt: it has to beportrayed as your own guilt. And that's what the journeyasks of you. You have to confess to every transgression youso presumptuously made along the way. This means riskingglory.

@@c)
You know now that you have sinned, and you know thisoccurred just to allow you to confess. Each admissiondiminishes the ego and increases the glory of God.

The Quantum Leap
(Sagittarius / Aquarius, Jupiter / Uranus)
Change of Paradigm; Leap Into the Unknown; The Sanyassin;Liberation from Religious Dogma; The Fool on the Roof; TheKnowledge of Knowing Nothing

@@a)
You are confused and disoriented; you can hardly hold ontothe old, clearly feel the need to take the leap (from theold), but lack courage.

@@b)
You will have to take the leap somewhere along the way. Youland on a new plane of consciousness and leave the old onebehind. This leap always involves an element of risk,perhaps even risking that (old) friends will think you aremad and not want anything to do with you.

@@c)
You find a new meaning which is radically different fromthe old one. You discover new realms of life, and perhapsfriends who make more sense than the old ones. You willhave made the leap!

Pythia
(Sagittarius / Pisces, Jupiter / Neptune)
Intuition; Priestess of the Oracle; Fortune Telling;Astrology (Interpretation of the Horoscope)

@@a)
You cling to specific advice or a prophecy someone hasmade. You've fallen into a trap. The source of your ownintuition has run dry because you have diverted the watersof your soul to a foreign riverbed. You will never solvethe puzzle this way.

@@b)
You will receive a sign -- perhaps not immediatelycomprehensible -- somewhere along your way. The seriousthought needed to solve the puzzle will lead you (almostunconsciously) to true spiritual awareness. In future, thiscan be an important step for the soul if you try to findthe solution in your own intuition -- that is, through yourinner Priestess -- instead of in the world outside.

@@c)
There is an old esoteric saying which goes: "When somethingis asked what it means, it won't let on". It won't tell youin words, but now you can understand it through images. Youwill have learned to trust your intuition, to rely onyourself as much as you presently do on your intellect.

Captivity
(Capricorn / Aquarius, Saturn / Uranus)
Excess Pressure; The Stone Which is Cast; Tension; TheImpending Explosion; "Ex-tortion"

@@a)
The problem is that deep down you are a prisoner and thestress caused by this situation continues to grow. The moreyou shake the bars to free yourself, the greater thepressure becomes.

@@b)
Along the way you have to accept the impossibility ofchoosing between responsibility and freedom. Have faith intimes like these being right for you, look for theirmeaning within yourself instead of in the world outside.

@@c)
You can now see that you are the "stone which was cast".You will only remain free and at the same time on track byrealizing your flight path is fixed and unalterable.

Moira
(Capricorn / Pisces, Saturn / Neptune)
Appeasement With Fate; Wisdom; Embitterment; Powerlessnessin the Face of Destiny; Thaw

@@a)
You are on a path leading to war with destiny. You have torealize that the path you are about to take will harden youand steal your breath. You are so hostile now that no onecan appease or approach you.

@@b)
You now have to struggle with an inner choice. There aretwo ways of tackling the current problem. One involvesreconciling yourself to the conditions of life -- i.e.acceptance. The other suggests rejection and becoming hard.You could miss a chance to forgive (yourself, someone elseor your destiny). The forces of wisdom and bitterness arefighting for control of your soul.

@@c)
You yourself have become Moira. You look around at theworld knowingly and graciously, filled with sympathy andgentle remorse for those who fight their destiny sorelentlessly. Your wisdom can now become a model of hopewhich serves as a reminder in their darkest hour.

(Aquarius / Pisces, Uranus / Neptune)
The Question of Salvation; Eternal Search; Lost Knowledge;The Objective Unconscious; The Depths of Archetype; TheOriginal Cause; Search for God.

@@a)
You are pursuing the wrong question, and that means youoften end up falling flat on your face. You stare into thecolorful lights of subjectivity and want to use thisquestion to arrive at a specific (convenient) answer. Thiscan only mislead you -- i.e. cause you to run in circles.Clarify the fact that you have to find a question whichdoesn't focus on you any more.

@@b)
You will have to readjust the focus of "light" on the way.Subjectivity is not your problem, it's objectivity andhaving been expelled from Paradise. You need to find thecourage not to want an answer to the question any more,just to ask it all the more firmly. This helps you get toyour feet each time you fall.

@@c)
You know now that you have reached a point where there areno answers. Calmness settles around you. You are guided,you trust in greater powers (objectivity) and discover oncemore (you learned it when you were one ...

they stilllike you or can be won over (will go to bed with 
you.)

You face a difficult decision, you can't make up your

thissacrifice is too great. So you remain hesitant. That's 
theheart of the matter. Two souls are living within 
thefeminine aspect of your breast. Do you want to be mother 
orlover (or for a man: have a mother or a lover)? A 
decisiononly serves to repress the problem. The card urges 
you toacknowledge your indecision. Nothing more!

    </problem>

Your path should lead you to identify two conflicting and-- 
on the whole -- mutually intolerant forms withinyourself. 
Each one says "take me!". In essence, this meansyou are 
unable to perform the role of any single one.

Your path takes you through a phase where it

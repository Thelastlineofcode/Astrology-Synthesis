The Warrior
(Aries / Mars)

Aggression; Capacity to Achieve; Conquest; Instigator;
Phallic Power; Energy of a New Beginning

PROBLEM:
Underlying the problem is the anger and aggression you have
not yet perceived and acknowledged. What has happened to
this persona? Why do you hide its feelings? Perhaps you
think they are inappropriate, that you are too refined and
everything must be governed by reason. Or perhaps you don't
want to confront your own cowardice.

WAY:
The task ahead of you involved becoming more instigative.
You are being asked to act in order to unravel the Gordian
knot holding you captive. You won't progress any further
without acquiring the resolve to act.

OUTCOME:
You regain your ability to act. You have the strength to
regenerate (now). The conclusion of the process heralds an
absolute new beginning in which you gather strength and the
warrior in you can embark upon a new round in the game of
life.

The Lover
(Taurus / Venus)

Worth; Attraction; Possession; Sociability; Physical
Attraction

PROBLEM:
You are a prisoner of your own feelings of worthlessness
deep down inside. This under-estimation of your self (the
words "I don't like myself") must be allowed to come to the
surface. It's no longer enough to use other people's labels
or seek their attention in regard to whether they still
like you or can be won over (will go to bed with you.)

WAY:
As much as esoteric circles propagate "letting go" of body
and matter, your path ahead involves thinking about Venus.
That means becoming her friend. Learn to see life as a
sensual experience and to respect the value your body as
the residence of the soul without exaggerating its
importance or wasting your energy.

OUTCOME:
Your path has led you to gather self-esteem. You have
learned to judge things realistically and to see them for
what they are: material things.

The Mediator
(Gemini / Mercury)

The Messenger (of the Gods); Intellect; Contact; The
Onlooker; Ease

PROBLEM:
You are unhappy with your position in life at the moment.
You find it too boring, banal, superficial. You don't want
to identify with the meaning and demands of Mercury; you
have blocked and dispelled the messenger. You have lost his
wings -- his lightness.

WAY:
Mercury offers his help in leading you to a solution. His
message reads: "Give yourself some distance and take a
quiet look at your present situation, speak your true
feelings and face matters with a detached and objective
attitude."

OUTCOME:
Regardless of how difficult the road may be, you will be
able to use "Hermes wings" to unite the unconscious with
the conscious and then observe yourself from a neutral
position -- in hindsight, maybe even with mischievous smile.

The Mother
(Cancer / Moon)

Femininity; The Family; The Infant; Feelings; Devotion;
Acceptance; The Spiritual Past

PROBLEM:
Your feelings -- the waters of your soul -- are being dried
up by the inner child which says "NO" and the "NO" which
closes off your inner being. You are frightened of feeling
your own self, scared of your feminine aspect and the
powerlessness it might generate.

WAY:
This card clearly advises you to follow the path of your
feelings. Discard reason for a moment and act intuitively.
Look for the child within and let this child live and
express itself.

OUTCOME:
Your journey will lead you to embrace the inner child and
live in harmony. You reach a homeland of your own, return
home to your feelings and your feminine aspect. You find
security in yourself.

The Ego
(Leo / Sun)

Power; Desire; Uniqueness; Glory; Fertility; Creativity;
Sexuality

In you for the moment a lack of aliveness exists. You lost
the entrance to your Kraft. Where did the life remain? You
must begin, your identity, yours be, to express. At the end
of this enterprise you live. Kraft, which to aliveness,
those you miss for the moment, return a little more to you.
The sun goes, a new day begins. You are then also again
with the heart with the thing.

PROBLEM:
You lack vitality, joy, and a necessary form of
hard-heartedness deep down. This means you cannot put your
energies to use. You might be trying to compensate for your
impotence and lack of power through dominant behaviour. You
need to ask yourself where you can still find life.

WAY:
The path ahead involves learning to express yourself, your
identity and your being. You need to live the way YOU are,
even if this hurts others. All this may not be as easy as
it sounds: just live your life!

OUTCOME:
Your path leads you back to life. Strength and vitality --
perhaps lacking at the moment -- return to you. You put
your heart and soul back into things.

The Servant
(Virgo / Mercury)

Reason; Accepting Reality; Rationality; Sobriety; Spiritual
Balance

PROBLEM:
This card says you refuse to accept your current position
in life. You like to keep a clean image by blaming others,
leading you to become caught up in your own projections.
But the finger ultimately points back at you.

WAY:
It's no use now: although it's a bitter pill to swallow,
you have to accept yourself; set your sights lower and
adjust to the conditions of life.

OUTCOME:
The result of your learning process is not the gold at the
end of the rainbow, but quiet, unprepossessing order and a
knowledge through which your soul finds composure and
resumes its rightful place.

The Partner
(Libra / Venus)

The Other; The Relationship; Balance; The Symbolon; The
Mirror; Supplementation; "The Better Half"

PROBLEM:
You are not yet prepared to look into the mirror of the
other and recognize what you see there as part of yourself.
You refuse to understand that the other is only expressing
your own otherness.

WAY:
The path involves learning to understand yourself in
others. This means mutual exchange and offering your hand
to the other in reconciliation (or understanding). It is
vital to meet someone along the way who opens your eyes.

OUTCOME:
You have rediscovered yourself in the other, found balance
and harmony between the inner and external partners. Now
the symbolon has been reunited. The pieces have been put
together.

The Seducer
(Scorpio / Pluto)

The Devil, The Imagination; The Idea; Suicide; Obligation;
Fixation; Fanaticism; The Underworld

PROBLEM:
You have become obsessed with an idea; now you are stuck.
You therefore give away part of your soul in the hope of
receiving something better. You are ruled by underworld
forces; you are gambling with the Devil. Find out what idea
it is you're obsessed with at the moment. Do nothing more
and nothing less than you need to.

WAY:
You can only reach the light at the end of the tunnel by
tackling the landscape of the underworld and crossing it.
Nothing more can be done; nor can it be "bettered" (avoid
looking for improvements -- that's one of his favorite
ideas). Only Virgil's words can help you now: "Look closely
and go on!"

OUTCOME:
A metamorphosis will take place. Old images must be
shattered, just as Moses destroyed the Golden Calf long
ago. These images will ultimately dissolve like a morning
fog in sunlight (because they never really existed!).

The Preacher
(Sagittarius / Jupiter)

The Priest; The Missionary; The Inner Therapist; Belief;
Insight; Philosophical View of the World

PROBLEM:
Where is your sympathy, the memory of your own spiritual
past? You presume to impose your opinions and knowledge
upon others while your own soul remains infertile.

WAY:
Remember! That's what this card tells you to do. Look for
an inner therapist (a person, if need be, who acts as a
mirror). And above all, retrace your steps. Solutions can
only be found in your past.

OUTCOME:
You will continue to grow, to become more open-minded and
tolerant. Mnemosyne, the Goddess of memory, has a treasure
waiting for you at the end of the journey: insight is the
wealth of the soul.

The Master
(Capricorn / Saturn)

Legitimacy; Responsibility; Fate; The Old Man; Death; The
Merciless Taskmaster

PROBLEM:
You have become hard, retreated into a shell where no one
can communicate with you or reach your soul. It is as if
you have withdrawn to a fortress of loneliness high in the
mountains. The fortress is part of you. Take a close look
and try to accept responsibility for having built it.

WAY:
The way through the problem is to learn to take life's
gravity into account. The game's over -- now you have to
confront your problems honestly. It's all about becoming an
"adult".

OUTCOME:
The outcome is that you now realize an objective destiny
prevails over you, a power (the power of fate) no one can
influence, one you accept and acknowledge. Now you are
responsible for yourself. That means responding and
accepting responsibility with a firm "yes".

The Jester
(Aquarius / Uranus)

Deliverer; Freedom; The Outsider; The "True" Hero;
Steppenwolf

PROBLEM:
You have forgotten the original meaning of the world
"freedom". You might believe you need to escape the prison
of your situation in life, but you shake helplessly, in
vain, at the bars of external conditions. You don't
understand the real message of The Jester: human beings
have to work on every opportunity, every spiritual path, in
order to grow from a situation.

WAY:
Try to find spiritual space beyond your present
complications. The path to freedom involves nothing more
than release, letting go of your current problem -- even if
this now seems paradoxical. Try to come in contact with
your own Jester and learn to laugh at yourself.

OUTCOME:
Conditions have catapulted you out of outdated and
superseded ways of approaching things. Your path of
development has given you wings -- and you didn't even
notice it. So fly!

PROBLEM:
You have lost your way. Your view of truth has become
clouded by illusions. You hide from yourself and fall for
your own tricks. You try to repress and avoid problems, you
shy away from facing reality. You are nowhere near solving
the problem and there is still a long way to go before you
being to deal with it.

WAY:
You need to take the word "release" quite literally.
Release yourself from the outer world, be more
contemplative and look within yourself. Your problem has no
bearing in the world outside. You can only look more
closely at yourself.

OUTCOME:
At first you don't recognize the end of your journey as it
is invisible in the outer world. But the star of a learned
truth will illuminate within your soul.

Defiance
(Cancer / Aries, Moon / Mars)

The Destructive Child; Rage; "Runaway Johnny"; Seething
Anger; Hatred for the Mother; Rejection of Femininity

PROBLEM:
Your belly aches because a little child within you is
throwing a tantrum, beating its fists angrily against the
depths of your soul and crying to get out. The whole world
is "evil", it plots against you. Accept that you are a
small child at the moment and still a long way from being a
sensible adult.

WAY:
Years and years of anger want to be let out. First of all,
you will have to go through a painful labor which brings
the deepest part of yourself into the world. Your energies
will not begin to flow again unless the pent-up anger can
be released and experienced. Find your own (perhaps
therapeutic) terms by which it becomes possible to freely
express your rage without hurting other people.

OUTCOME:
It is only possible to be at peace with the "little tyrant"
once we have lived out our childhood, those feelings of
defiance, anger and annoyance. One day you will have to
embrace the child.

The Two Faces of Eve
(Cancer / Taurus, Moon / Venus)

Role Conflict; Ambivalent Feelings; Two Souls Within One
Body; Wife and Lover

PROBLEM:
You face a difficult decision, you can't make up your mind.
A sacrifice is called for one way or the other, and this
sacrifice is too great. So you remain hesitant. That's the
heart of the matter. Two souls are living within the
feminine aspect of your breast. Do you want to be mother or
lover (or for a man: have a mother or a lover)? A decision
only serves to repress the problem. The card urges you to
acknowledge your indecision. Nothing more!

WAY:
Your path should lead you to identify two conflicting and
-- on the whole -- mutually intolerant forms within
yourself. Each one says "take me!". In essence, this means
you are unable to perform the role of any single one.

OUTCOME:
You discover ultimately that both aspects deserve a place
in your soul; both have their time and place, they feel
close to you but not to each other. You accept the distance
they keep from one another.

Articulation
(Cancer / Gemini, Moon / Mercury)

Discussing Feelings; Psychotherapy (Psychoanalysis); Making
Contact with Feelings; The Connection Between Mind and
"Belly"

PROBLEM:
You prefer to remain on the surface and ignore your
feelings. You do everything to avoid perceiving or having
to express them. But you have known for a long time what
needs to be addressed. You need to understand that
unexpressed feelings prey on the mind and, by their very
nature, can trigger off illness.

WAY:
The time has come to express what's happening in your life
and what you feel. There's no progress without discussion
-- only backsliding. Find a friend to talk to, or a
psychologist if no one is prepared to listen.

OUTCOME:
Reason and instinct come in contact with one another. You
neither let yourself to be terrorized by feelings (and
terrorize others) nor allow them to be silenced. You can
express them as they arise. And you don't need to make a
big thing of them; they are not that important.

Incompatibility
(Cancer / Leo, Moon / Sun)

Expulsion from Paradise; The Double; Marriage; Day and
Night; Yin and Yang

PROBLEM:
The heart of the matter is a failure to understand the
incompatibility between man and woman. As a man you do not
understand the "woman in you"; as a woman you do not
understand the "man in you". Try to see things from the
other's perspective for a change.

WAY:
Your path takes you through a phase where it becomes
necessary to devote more attention to the neglected aspect
of your self than you have already done (you know best
which part that is). You have to demand acceptance of your
femininity from your masculine aspect, or vice versa.

OUTCOME:
The path has led to both aspects having equal importance.
Although this alone cannot resolve their incompatibility,
you are aware of both sides now and value each accordingly.
You have an inkling of what Paradise is, and that moment of
mutual recognition (at the beginning and end of the day)
causes your heart to beat a little faster.

Sympathy; Watching over Someone; Caring; Grief; The Problem
Child; Helper Syndrome

PROBLEM:
You have forgotten there is someone dependent on your
sympathy and care. The one waiting for you to care for him
or her in the world outside only mirrors the small child
within who wants attention.

WAY:
Take care of yourself. Look after your own emotional
well-being. Don't allow yourself to be distracted by
others' feelings. The small child in you is crying and
seeks attention.

OUTCOME:
The mother/child relationship has been restored within you.
You don't feel so frightened, nor so helpless and at the

yourself.

The Family
(Cancer / Libra, Moon / Venus)

The Third Force; Spiritual Contact; "WE"; Confession to a
Relationship; Compound; Cohesion

PROBLEM:
You have contributed to the creation of a third force but
refuse to become involved. You refuse to accept it
spiritually, choosing to give the third force over for
adoption instead.

WAY:
The way through the problem will demand a confession. But a
confession means spiritually accepting something more
troublesome because the generation of a third force

OUTCOME:
A common entity will arise, a third force which is greater
than its individual components. Rather than belong to you,
it has a life of its own which needs both adults for a
while to nourish its spiritual energies and allow it to
grow.

You have contributed to the creation of a third force but
refuse to become involved. You refuse to accept it
spiritually, choosing to give the third force over for
adoption instead.

The way through the problem will demand a confession. But a
confession means spiritually accepting something more
troublesome because the generation of a third force

Abortion
(Cancer / Scorpio, Moon / Pluto)

Selling the Soul; Sacrificed Femininity; Imagining
Feelings; Spiritual Dependence; Depression; Concept of
Motherhood

PROBLEM:
The God of the Underworld has you firmly in his clutches.
You have sacrificed your soul to the enemy of the living
and now seek comfort in others. You cling to the hope that
someone can free you from darkness. The path that leads you
to light is long -- you must first descend into the depths,
into the world of the shadow, before you find your way back
to the living.

WAY:
You have to descent into the underworld with your feelings,
just as Persephone did before you. That's where you frankly
admit that it will take all you have before you can buy
back your feelings and surface from the depths.

OUTCOME:
You have sacrificed a lot: images and imagined feelings
which were surrogates and self-delusions. A lot had to be
"torn from your soul". The wounds will hurt for a long time
but now you have more freedom and independence. You are no
longer bound by what you have sacrificed; it has no power
over you any more.

Mnemosyne

Memory; Therapy; Insight into the Soul; Personal Truth; The

PROBLEM:
The waters of Lethe flow through your soul, leaving no
chance to remember. You deny the (feminine) healer within
you and suffer from a spell of forgetting. Daylight fades
around you. But Mnemosyne would like to make contact with
you, let you know that your problem can only be solved by
remembering.

WAY:
Therapy of one form or another will be needed to help you
get through the problem. It does not have to be in the form
of a (paid) "worldly" therapist, although this would also
be useful.

OUTCOME:
As difficult as it was, the process has given you an

The Ice Queen
(Cancer / Capricorn, Moon / Saturn)

Hardened Femininity; The Lonely Child; The Strict Mother;
Feelings of Guilt; Depression

PROBLEM:
The underlying cause of your problem is an inner persona
which has closed off its feelings. You have curled up like
a hedgehog, built a wall around your feelings ("a shell"),
and now your reactions are cold and distant. The task is to
take responsibility for your hardness instead of
attributing it to the world.

WAY:
It's time to be more adult. You might ask what is left of
all your tears. The feminine aspect of your self can only
surface if you deal with tears arising from loss or hurt
feelings (not to be confused with tears of self-pity --
they're easy to come by).

OUTCOME:
Your path leads you to take more responsibility for your
own insensitive feelings. Then you stop blaming other
people for your own callousness. It comes from you! Only
this knowledge can bring about a thaw.

Deliverance
(Cancer / Aquarius, Moon / Uranus)

Emotional Release; Leaving Childhood Behind; Cold Freedom;
Insecurity; Exile from the Homeland

PROBLEM:
You don't want to accept the passing of a secure phase.
Growth is long overdue and it is high time you hatched from
the egg. The protective shell may well have to be broken
open from outside because you are too frightened to choose
to leave narrow boundaries.

WAY:
You already know that the shell has deep cracks, that you
need to give birth to something new. A certain theme in
your life has aged. Your path involves pecking away the
remaining pieces of the shell, and that takes a lot of
strength and hard work -- but you know there is no turning
back now.

OUTCOME:
You've hatched from the shell -- it's cold outside. But you
know it is all part of becoming an adult. Time will give
you strength; the soul will grow its "feathers". And this,
according to Plato, is the most important thing that can
happen.

Sleeping Beauty-Slumber
(Cancer / Pisces, Moon / Neptune)

The Dream; Longing; The Unborn; The Bewitched Soul;
Intuition; Woman in the Realm of Oblivion; Waiting

PROBLEM:
You are homeless, insecure and expectant. A wave of longing
is unleashed in you and there is no one who can really ease
it. This might be a sweet kind of pain, but it is also
deeply disturbing because you hide yourself away. Feelings
like these cannot be changed -- they can only be endured.

WAY:
It's true that you feel lonely, but you also realize how
the heavens can only address you in homelessness. Look at
your dreams (take flights of fancy) so you can feel the
messages inside you more clearly. If you keep looking
outside yourself, the search will be in vain.

OUTCOME:
You discover a more profound, invisible world next to the
visible one, and there you will find a guide. For the sake
of "intuition", this guide will show you the miracles of
the objective world and let you forget your loneliness.

The Battle
(Leo / Aries, Sun / Mars)

Power Struggle; Victory of Pyrrhus; Self-annihilation; An
"Own-Goal"; Shadow-Boxing

PROBLEM:
You have become tangled up in your own aggressions. You
believe you have identified the enemy in the world outside,
and now, despairing, seek victory whilst failing to realize
you are fighting yourself. You are your own worst enemy.
The more vehemently you try to win, the more energy you
waste -- ultimately, it leads to self-annihilation.

WAY:
The task ahead is to seize territory and win ground for
yourself. No one is going to just hand it over. It's a
tooth and nail battle. There is something to be learned,
even from close victory or defeat: a little courage and you
will learn how to face up to your opponents and fight.

OUTCOME:
You have discovered that an outside enemy is only ever a
reflection of an inner persona and a part of yourself. That
doesn't mean, however, that you should not take up arms
when need be: it's up to you to decide whether or not to
fight.

The Ruler
(Leo / Taurus, Sun / Venus)

Feminine Power and Strength; Grandeur and Splendor; The
Queen; Using Sensuality and Erotic Charm

PROBLEM:
You alienated yourself from your ego; it can only be (or
has been) reached by means of other people. You are
prepared to "sell out" by clinging to someone whose power
and strength you suppose will help you. Your intrinsic
sense of self-esteem lacks foundation.

WAY:
You have to learn to use your own charms to achieve what
you want now. Try to view charm and the powers of
attraction as part of a game you play, things you use to
help satisfy desired and achieve your aims. The ego game is
one we all play -- there's scarcely any other.

OUTCOME:
You have realized you're not a sovereign Queen but someone
who is dependent on others -- and that includes your
subjects. You use your position in a friendly and loyal
manner, without false modesty, and without feeling the need
to hide your borrowed feathers.

The Actor

The Role; Self-portrayal; The Assumed Identity; "Theater";
Stage Backdrop; Intellectualism

PROBLEM:
You fail to understand that you only act a role in present
situation. The real person is hidden behind the "role"; it
may be a while before you accept responsibility for it. For
the time being, it's enough to know that your importance is
borrowed or acted out. Of course, you are afraid of someone
removing the mask. But who exactly could be revealed?

WAY:
Play the role. Walk on-stage and start acting. Don't be
concerned if the character isn't really you. The stage is
your world now -- so act as well as you can. Does all this
sound a bit false? Don't let it bother you. This is what
your path demands. Only take yourself as seriously as the
role asks of you.

OUTCOME:
You act the role now without having identified with it. You
don't take it seriously: you know it's just a game -- you
can even say as much. You can admit it to yourself and to
others. Who could remove the mask now?

PROBLEM:
You are under a magic spell. But don't take this the wrong
way: your own magical past returns to you even if you may
feel the victim of "sacrifice". You are trapped in
spiritual chains and live according to an image of life
which consumes a lot of strength and life energy.

You live life in a bubble, like homunculus inside a

OUTCOME:

You have no role to play at the moment (in both senses of

Don't waste your energy, you have to cross a no man's land
now. You are not at the helm of a boat, you drift on a raft

OUTCOME:
You learn from the outcome that solutions are only found
within yourself, not in teh world outside. You also
understand now what it means to close your eyes to the

in your growth which will make your ego smaller and your

Eros

Attraction of the Sexes; Sex; Flirtation; Body Contact;
"Cher-Chez La Femme"

PROBLEM:
The card would like to remind you of the theme (and
problem) of your sexuality. It wants to tell you: "Human
beings can't live from the spirit alone; we have a body
too". It can mean two things: either this theme was allowed
to run on so long that you have dried up, or you focus on
nothing but the theme itself and have become closed to
everything else (surely you know which one is true). In
both cases the car says: "Take more care of your
sexuality". Cupid is finding its target.

WAY:
The way ahead involves finding the courage to be sensual
again, learning to understand your own inhibitions (or
excesses) and discovering that Amor has its own way of
uniting the pieces.

OUTCOME:
You understand the scope of the sexual game without
overestimating or underestimating its significance.

The Stocks
(Aries / Gemini, Mars / Mercury)

Gossip; Defamation; Destruction with Words; Moaning;
Wailing Willy (Yapping); Character Assassination; A Sharp
Tongue

PROBLEM:
You are about to propagate a vicious lie or become the
victim of lies yourself. Neither of these -- whether you
are victim or culprit -- is any more noble than the other
as both show you are susceptible to gossip and lies, that
you have not understood the whole meaning. Whatever the
case, you believe you are not implicated in it being
spread. That's a mistake!

WAY:
Your journey will not spare you the ignominy of the stocks.
Your actions will be made public and it would be a good
thing to prepare yourself -- yes, even help the process
along (if you don't find it too difficult). Otherwise you
will be taken by surprise. The easiest way is to go public.
That's what we call "outing".

OUTCOME:
The matter you hid has come to light -- now acknowledge it.
Standing at the stocks means admitting to your most
unsavory characteristics and, most importantly, to
aggression.

Guilt
(Aries / Virgo, Mars / Mercury)

The Unintentional Act; Acting in Good Faith; Projection;
Victim-Culprit Relationship; Guilt and Innocence

PROBLEM:
The perpetrator in you fight for his life, for his very
innocence. He is on a voracious search for defence. You
cannot acknowledge the act and grant those redeeming words:
"I was the one!" The threads holding victim and perpetrator
together are a noose around your heart which steals your
breath and freedom.

WAY:
Guilt is unavoidable. Someone is going to be hurt no matter
which solution your path leads you to choose. Only one
thing can help you: confess!

OUTCOME:
Why do you bother asking anyway? Mankind is doomed by fate.
These words taken from the Oracle of Delphi are written
upon the walls of the temple at your journey's end. You
accept that the theme of guilt is part of life: a state
beyond guilt and innocence existed only in Paradise before
the fall, before knowledge of Good and Evil, when victim
and culprit were one.

Disagreement
(Aries / Libra, Mars / Venus)

Battle of the Sexes; Clash; The Hatchet; Breaking the
Symbolon

PROBLEM:
You don't want to perceive a relationship conflict. That
could mean a conflict with your partner, a neighbor, friend
or family member. You are afraid to argue and clash. Your
partner, placed in the position of having to enact your
aggressions, has become your enemy. This pressure -- which
you want to repress with counter-pressure -- could just as
easily surface on the bodily plane (as cramps, pain, fever,
or agitation).

WAY:
The one and only thing you can do is remove the bone of
contention. You can only progress through open discussion.
This path offers you very little harmony in the
relationship.

OUTCOME:
You have learned to live with the irreconcilable difference
between the sexes. If you follow your ego's power to assert
itself, you will inevitably lose the "we". If you give in
to togetherness, you will sacrifice a part of yourself. You
can't have your cake and eat it too.

"Undead"

PROBLEM:
Part of you has died. This means you have attached yourself
to someone else, chosen this person as your perpetrator,
and may now consider yourself to be a victim. You hope to
be blessed with life; you want to share this person's
energies, and now you are surprised by his or her control

WAY:
Acknowledge that one part of you is heteronomous. Discover
which of your personae has descended into the realm of the
shadow and the underworld and invades alien lifeforms.
Identify this parasitic creature, it creates shackles which
hold you down.

OUTCOME:
The vampire will die. This frightens you, but it is the
cure. It doesn't mean a complete death: the vampire
stealing part of your life will surface and die in the

PROBLEM:
You act against your own good judgement (repress the
insights you have gained) and turn your sword on those who
(you think) dissent. You want your "correct" opinions to

wage war and destroy.

WAY:
Sometime you will have to stand up for your convictions,
even if that means a fight. It is not enough just to
achieve insight and knowledge if you are not prepared to
back them with deeds.

OUTCOME:
Ultimately, your actions are guided by insight and

aggression; your well-thought out actions are driven by
conviction. Now you know how easy it is to start a fight --
shadow-box -- with yourself.

The Golden Girl
(Taurus / Gemini, Venus / Mercury)

Cinderella; Feminine Competition; Presentation of Values;
Grimm's "Pechmarie"; The Bluestocking; The Beautiful and
the Ugly

PROBLEM:
Deep down you feel inferior. You suffer from low
self-esteem because you think someone either makes you
appear plain and inadequate or that this is how you really
are. Both suggest you get hung up on making comparisons
(competition), something that can only make you lose in the
long term. As long as you try to increase your self-esteem
by appearing attractive, you will remain a prisoner on the
plane of self-portrayal -- in essence, you don't believe in
yourself. You feel inferior.

WAY:
An essential part of the journey is to take a good look at
your competitive behavior. How or in regard to what person
do you dress yourself up to appear better than you really
are? Take an honest look at how your lack of self-esteem
surfaces.

OUTCOME:
When the problem is over you see that portraying
self-esteem is just a theatrical role. It is up to you to
decide whether you continue the role or bid it farewell.
Neither one is of great consequence, no matter what you
decide.

PROBLEM:
At some point you built a wall around yourself and, seeking
security (and in fear), became your own incarcerated slave.
"Excess" plays an important role here. You think, "The

can make good sense. You find a balanced (and
non-restricting) approach to this theme. Security has its

The Gilded Cage
(Taurus / Libra, Venus / Venus)

The Relationship as Imprisonment; The Partner as
Possession; Jealousy; Bribing Your Partner; Devotion

PROBLEM:
"Buying" and "being bought" are bitter aspects in your
relationship. Relationships of this kind are doomed to
"possession" and "jealousy". You are trapped no matter
whether you are the "possessor" or the "possessed". You are
the prisoner of the gilded cage who grows more passive and
less flexible over time. You paid a high price for
"security".

WAY:
The task at hand is to make your relationship (or
friendship) more meaningful. You have to "invest" in it and
accept a possible loss of freedom. Otherwise it will
continue to lack the foundation and the fertile soil to
grow.

OUTCOME:
The journey leads you to a realization that the door of the
cage was never closed. Two people who belong together and
provide warmth for one another should not isolate
themselves in "mutual reassurance". Devotion is a natural
part of a relationship only when mutual growth and
development are possible. But loss of freedom might be the
price to pay.

PROBLEM:
You hang by invisible threads. You don't realize you are
trying to conform to an image. Expressed metaphorically,
you want to become a larva. The God of the Underworld
seduces you so perfectly that you are unable to distinguish
between image and reality. It's like a virus with such a
long incubation period that you don't remember where and

WAY:
Try to find out how this alien virus turned you into a
doll. The task is to escape, to emerge from the chrysalis
and get back to your true individuality. This isn't easy as
there is always the risk of moving on to another image
(unwittingly) after metamorphosis.

OUTCOME:
You find the self-esteem your personality needs. The
strings are no longer controlled by your (and other's)
self-image. The path leads you away from the controlled

The Farewell

Exiles From the Homeland; Exile; Sudden Material Collapse;

PROBLEM:
You would like to remain in the protective shell of your

"hard". There is a danger of your roots driving down so
deep that you can never find the strength again to free
yourself. That's why fate has ordained deportation. It

WAY:
You will have to give up your security or perhaps even your
friends (or important groups of people). Certain
affiliations and aspects of your life have become too
antiquated to support you; there is nothing more you can
learn from them.

OUTCOME:

The Garden of Spirits
(Taurus / Pisces, Venus / Neptune)

The World Behind the World; Homelessness; Rootlessness;
Cinderella Syndrome; Disregard for the Material World;
Allegory of the Visible World

PROBLEM:
You have drifted unwittingly into a reverie. You flee from
reality by waiting for your dream to be realized. These
kinds of dreams are like a drug, alienating you all the
more from the world and those you find difficult to leave.
They have lulled you into a false sense of reality. Above

The important step in your development is to embark on a
journey at some point which takes you away from your

means freeing yourself of most of your belongings. You can

The Strategist
(Gemini / Virgo, Mercury / Mercury)

The Intellectual; Control; Tactic; Science; Life from the
Head; The Diplomat; Causality (Law of Cause and Effect)

PROBLEM:
Your life is in dry-dock at the moment. A virus keeps you
trapped and it's called "reason" or "rationality". You only
know the waters of feeling from books, using your head to
try to control the world.

WAY:
Act intelligently and only after careful consideration.
Plan your moves carefully -- don't get carried away by
feelings. Take your time, get things into perspective.
First of all, remember that everything has its consequence.

OUTCOME:
A lot of things will have been clarified and rearranged.
The point is to learn to understand more about the
direction your life is taking. You will start seeing cause
and effect as a whole. Now you understand and adjust to the
causes which have to produce certain effects.

Vanity Fair
(Gemini / Libra, Mercury / Venus)

Seeing and Being Seen; Relationship as Ego Trip; Passing
the Time; Being With Someone; Staging Togetherness

PROBLEM:
Your relationship (or the relationship you seek) is hollow
and empty at the moment because it is an ego-wish. Either
you have become someone's "ornament" or you use your
partner to inflate your own ego. Instead of achieving deep
togetherness in your relationship, you find boredom and
disinterest which you try to overcome with "games".

WAY:
Your partnership is going through a very ordinary,
unremarkable phase: no highs, no lows. You are both simply
co-existing. It's the only way to solve your problem at the
moment. This way, you might create the peace and quiet you
need to unwind and relax, give yourself the distance you
need to be more objective.

OUTCOME:
Appearances are a normal component of life and
relationships. They are part of the game, and you will have
learned to join in without placing too much importance on
them.

The Pied Piper
(Gemini / Scorpio, Mercury / Pluto)

Being Tricked; The Suggestion; The Propagandist; The
Con-artist; Buying Addiction; Advertising (Images Designed
to Seduce You)

PROBLEM:
You don't realize you have fallen for someone or some idea.
You are a prisoner now, confused by the alluring and
(admittedly) beguiling tones of the flute. Unfortunately,
there was no one who could have tied you to the mast -- as
Ulysses was in his time -- to prevent you being harmed by
the Sirens' sweet songs.

WAY:
It is impossible to avoid being attracted by the sounds of
the flute, even if they become empty promises. The more you
find out about life and what's best for you, the less often
you will fall for seduction in the future.

OUTCOME:
Ultimately, you will miss out on what was promised. That
means you realize someone was dangling a carrot under your
nose. You might even feel like a donkey now. But the truth
is, you've finally left your armchair and got yourself
moving -- and that's what it was all about.

Master and Disciple
(Gemini / Sagittarius, Mercury / Jupiter)

Learning and Teaching; Spiritual Difference; Eternal
Student; Con-man; Spiritual Non-commitment

PROBLEM:
You have lost your way and become caught somewhere between
the role of teacher and pupil. You can't see yourself as
the pupil, but nor can you find the courage to teach. This
no man's land is robbing you of intellectual energy and
makes you feel trapped between "no longer being" and
"having become". The knowledge you gained still lacks
responsibility -- you are not growing spiritually at the
moment.

WAY:
You will have to "beat" two different paths. On the left
path you remain a pupil, on the right path you will have
become the teacher. Both belong to your current development
with equal time and measure.You will be on your way twin
"drive" them.

OUTCOME:
You have become a spiritual "medium". You impart and accept
knowledge according to need and your designated group. You
can do both now. Your knowledge has acquired therapeutic
powers and entails responsibility, reaching into the depths
of existence and becoming a river which enriches the soil.
And now you can accept how long it will take the river to
flow into the sea.

PROBLEM:
You have lost your agility at present. Your movements are
inert and lame; you cannot advance. You still haven't
understood why this point in your development is so
important that you have to stay there for a long time.

WAY:
You have to take more responsibility for your thoughts as
well as your actions. The path involves coping with
handicaps and encouraging yourself to be more patient.

OUTCOME:
The person is sent on his or her way. There are periods of
wandering alone in the desert and moments of elation when
he or she may dance and leap with joy. You will get to know
both phases and have learned to accept responsibility for
this moment in life's journey.

Insignificant Cause and Momentous Effect

PROBLEM:
You are neglecting something, you want to walk before you
can crawl. You have disturbed the natural flow of events
and now your rash and hasty actions have led you to the
edge of a precipice. A piece of the path is missing between
the first step and the third. You want to pluck success out
of thin air without going through the effort of taking one
step at a time. Now you are literally suspended in thin air.

WAY:
You can't get ahead using the usual ways and means.
Conditions call for unconventional and spontaneous action.

OUTCOME:
You have broken free of everyday life, escaped from
functional neutrality. You will have learned to read the
signs of the heavens. You can learn more from the
butterflies than pure "logic" will ever teach you.

PROBLEM:

things are beyond your control. The world doesn't respond
to your efforts any more; chaos seems to conspire against
you. Your words don't explain what you want to say. You
still haven't learned to remain still. You are not yet

WAY:

The angel forbids you to swap or betray secrets. Your path
only concerns you, so don't try to describe or explain it,
or make embellishments to impress others.

Everyday Life in the Relationship
(Virgo / Libra, Mercury / Venus)

Lack of Thrill; Dullness; Relationship Obligations;
Sameness; Erosion; Lack of Incentive

PROBLEM:
One of your relationships has lost its spice and begun to
pale. Neither partner does anything to restore its color.
This could mean a relationship between lovers, a married
couple or even a relationship at your workplace. What was
once so promising, now involves adjustment, obligation and
self-imposed demands.

WAY:
Relationships create forces which ask you to conform. It is
important to look closely at your illusions during the
heyday of the relationship (the fact that you dream of a
never-ending honeymoon) and learn to restore value in
everyday life.

OUTCOME:
Ultimately, you will have understood how the togetherness
of "we" is more significant than the "I" of the ego. The
next step is to understand everyday life as an activity --
not as a "challenge", but as something you "practice.

Castigation
(Virgo / Scorpio, Mercury / Pluto)

Self-punishment; Compulsion to Rid Yourself of Guilt;
Flagellation; Compulsive Neurosis; Exorcism; Serving an
Ideal

PROBLEM:
You suffer from the spell of a (perhaps mild) compulsive
image. You are trapped somehow in a vicious circle of
compulsive "innocence and cleanliness". You think you can
ward off evil -- in thought or deed -- with constant
self-purification. These rituals are occasionally so subtle
and self-fulfilling that you consider them as part of
everyday life. But they in fact rob you of an important
element of your lifeforce and control you unconsciously,
just like a puppet on a string.

WAY:
There are times in the life of every human being when it is
necessary to forego desires in order to serve a higher
ideal. The path ahead involves submitting to the ideal.

OUTCOME:
Rituals are energy fields which are generated by the
constant repetition of actions (or sometimes a combination
of these actions). You have learned to distinguish
meaningful rituals (of subjugation) from meaningless
(possessive) rites.

The Inquisition
(Virgo / Sagittarius, Mercury / Jupiter)

Interrogation; Intolerance; (Political) Hypocrite;
Disregarding Differences of Opinion; The Security of
Feeling Right; The Search for the Guilty Party

PROBLEM:
You are like the hypocrite who tries to prove his innocence
by being intolerant and dismissive of other people's ideas
and beliefs. You renounce their beliefs and pursue your
own. You are so convinced that you just can't be told.

WAY:
You will be subjected to severe interrogation (and perhaps
prosecution). Fate will use the powers of force and the
inquisition to squeeze the truth from you. It's not a
matter of guilt or innocence (although it may seem that way
on the surface), but of the process unleashed by the
pressure (or blackmail). This process allows you to take
another step forward.

OUTCOME:
Trust in achieving belief and a deep spiritual (and
religious) experience at the end of your journey. You have
become more tolerant (of yourself and others) and no longer
feel compelled to prove you are the only one who knows.

PROBLEM:
You block your lifeforce at present and are almost
paralysed. One part of your soul stands in stony defence at
a threshold, refusing to accept its arrival. You repress
the very thing you need to do, and therefore repress (or
try to repress) your own fear.

WAY:
Your path leads you to an important encounter with the fear
of dying. Now is the right time to read the Books of the
Dead, to look at those rituals which can make you more
familiar with death and teach you how it can be your
friend. By learning to die, you also develop the courage
and strength to outlive and survive those numerous litter
(ego) deaths which shape our existence.

OUTCOME:
You are not afraid of death any more. You have died a

PROBLEM:
You are burdened by a guilt which is now manifested as

WAY:
It's about time to build a house for your guilt and

worked out the bearing that an action has upon your soul.

OUTCOME:

can only transform themselves once you have assented to
their judgement. Then they can curtail their wrath and turn
into the gentle Eumenides.

Deception
(Virgo / Pisces, Mercury / Neptune)

Self-Deception; Foul Play; The Swindle; Sleight of Hand;
The Real Crook; Order in Chaos

PROBLEM:
You are tricking yourself. You deceive yourself and project
the self-deception onto someone else, creating a
self-fulfilling prophecy by "forcing" this person to betray
you. It is difficult to see yourself in this mirror, but
the longer you try to avoid your reflection, the cloudier
and more opaque it will become.

WAY:
Your path is in chaos and confusion. You cannot see a way
out any more. However, this confusion can be healing as it
forces you to distinguish between dreams and your need for
security, obligation and ideals. You need to work for a
balance between conforming (caused by fear) and letting the
future to unfold.

OUTCOME:

(Libra / Sagittarius, Venus / Jupiter)

The meaning of the Relationship; Lucky in Love; The
Marriage Vows; Partnership as Process of Understanding; The
Golden Anniversary

PROBLEM:
At the moment you repress any knowledge of the
"relationship agenda". Either you imagine you have already
done what you need to in relationship or that there is no
such thing as the perfect partner. Whatever the case, your
inner relationship persona still has a thing or two to
learn. It lacks an understanding of what partnership is all
about.

WAY:
You are confronted by the stairway to the temple of meaning
in your relationship. Don't hesitate to climb it. Your path
is clear now. Instead of looking for faults in your partner
(that would be a step backwards), look consciously ahead
and foster the vision of a higher goal: not a goal which
serves to fulfil your subjective wants, but one leading to
the birth of spiritual togetherness.

OUTCOME:
Coming at your journey's end, this card has the meaning of
"luck". This means happiness which can grow from spiritual
togetherness. Therefore you understand the significance of
a relationship and the meaning of the sacred vows of
marriage.

PROBLEM:
You have strayed far from your truth. You repress the pain

the trains to keep running together. Just as water and oil
can only be (temporarily) mixed by a lot of stirring, you

WAY:
Your path through life involves too much "we" and too

OUTCOME:
You have created your own freedom both within and without

The King's Two Children
(Libra / Pisces, Venus / Neptune)

The Romantic Relationship; The Dream Partner ("Dual Soul");
Unrelatedness; Illusion of Becoming One; Dreaming of Love

PROBLEM:
You are caught in the illusion of a relationship. Your
longing poisons the fertile earth of your soul.You close
your eyes to loneliness and continuously weave a magic
carpet which can neither carry you nor keep you warm.

WAY:
Disillusion awaits you on the path ahead. Your longing for
love and partnership is just a carrot before the (donkey's)
nose which is meant to motivate you and bring growth. If
you don't burst the bubble yourself, you will become lost
in illusion.

OUTCOME:
You know now that unfulfilled longing has a specific
purpose. It lets you feel the thing you miss and propels
you into the world to find it. This puts you on the trail
of life's secret: that we are all part of the greater whole
and painfully miss unity.

Black Mass
(Scorpio / Sagittarius, Pluto / Jupiter)

Idol Worship; Religious and Esoteric Dogma; Unshakeable
Belief; Positive Thinking; The Sublime Fanatic; Total
Conviction

PROBLEM:
You have become lost in a particular insight and now
believe you have found the truth. But you are only being
fooled by a subtle notion (of the truth). You are trapped
spiritually.

WAY:
You need to commit yourself for a while along the way: that
means following a theoretical model (eg. of enlightenment).
Unless you find a model, there will be no insight or links
to the whole at all. But you should also realize that
(after a period of time) you can become inflexible and
trapped in this model.

OUTCOME:
You have understood how you held onto something
(spiritually) dead. That in itself is the insight you need
to break the connection. All you need to do is realize you
have stagnated. The ghost will then disappear of its own
accord.

Depression
(Scorpio / Capricorn, Pluto / Saturn)

Being Trapped; Petrification; The Chamber of Lethe; The
Seat of Forgetting; The Dark Side of the Soul

PROBLEM:
An important part of your life is presently in a stage of
petrification. There is nothing you can do except become
aware of the process and identify with the inner persona
which is responsible. You have been lulled into resting
upon the "Seat of Forgetting". You called for it yourself
in order to be spared the truth. There is something
specific you don't want to accept, and the price you pay is
darkness and emptiness.

WAY:
You won't be spared the trek through the inner realm of
petrification. Your path leads through the chamber of
forgetting. This makes you remember. No matter what you
see, think about Virgil's words as he led Dante through the
underworld: "Look ahead and go on".

OUTCOME:
You have been through hard times and now see light at the
end of the tunnel. Old structures have been transformed by
a slow, prolonged life process. A new lease on life now
awaits you, apparently born from nothing.

The Phoenix
(Scorpio / Aquarius, Pluto / Uranus)

Metamorphosis; Liberation of the Spiritual Bird; Death and
Resurrection (Dying and Being Reborn); Disorientation;
Sloughing

PROBLEM:
You cling to ideas and thinking patterns which are old and
doomed to die not noticing how antiquated they have become.
In a certain sense, you are clinging to something "dead".

WAY:
Nothing in your life will remain the same. Your journey
leads through a process of dying from which -- like Phoenix
from the ashes -- you will rise if you have the courage to
let old situations decay. A rise can only follow a fall.

OUTCOME:
Phoenix rises from the ruins of the past in brilliant
colors -- a phase of life is over. Your soul has freed and
liberated itself from obstinacy.

The False Halo
(Scorpio / Pisces, Pluto / Neptune)

Good and Evil (Polarity); Conception of heaven; Hypocrisy;
The Fallen Angel; Impartiality

PROBLEM:
The dark angel is tricking you at the moment. Of course, he
has clothed himself in a wonderful coat of lights and
proclaimed your work, your guru and the new relationship to
be noble, holy and God-fearing. but he is only dangling a
carrot in front of your nose so that you will trot along in
his direction. You therefore don't realize that an
eagerness to do Good has left you at his mercy.

WAY:
Your path leads you through a painful learning process: in
short, that "thou shalt not create an image". Every image,
noble as it might be, is balsam for your ego and poison for
your soul. Now is the time to get to work on your shadow
and remove the mask from images and ideas.

OUTCOME:
You will understand that there is no light without its
shadow "darkness", that no darkness can exist without the
shadow of light. It's time to stop being so biased as you
see one in the many and many in one.

Confession
(Sagittarius / Capricorn, Jupiter / Saturn)

Confession; Purification of the Subjective; Therapist's
Responsibility (The Priest); Insight into Destiny; The
Bridge Between Subjectivity and Objectivity

PROBLEM:
Your soul carries a burden which needs to be acknowledged
in the world outside. You have to confess. But do you think
this would only diminish your greatness? You're absolutely
right. Others will notice that you are not as enlightened
as you would have liked them to believe.

WAY:
It's not enough just to talk about guilt: it has to be
portrayed as your own guilt. And that's what the journey
asks of you. You have to confess to every transgression you
so presumptuously made along the way. This means risking
glory.

OUTCOME:
You know now that you have sinned, and you know this
occurred just to allow you to confess. Each admission
diminishes the ego and increases the glory of God.

Liberation from Religious Dogma; The Fool on the Roof; The
Knowledge of Knowing Nothing

PROBLEM:
You are confused and disoriented; you can hardly hold onto
the old, clearly feel the need to take the leap (from the
old), but lack courage.

WAY:
You will have to take the leap somewhere along the way. You
land on a new plane of consciousness and leave the old one
behind. This leap always involves an element of risk,
perhaps even risking that (old) friends will think you are
mad and not want anything to do with you.

OUTCOME:
You find a new meaning which is radically different from
the old one. You discover new realms of life, and perhaps
friends who make more sense than the old ones. You will
have made the leap!

Pythia
(Sagittarius / Pisces, Jupiter / Neptune)

Intuition; Priestess of the Oracle; Fortune Telling;
Astrology (Interpretation of the Horoscope)

PROBLEM:
You cling to specific advice or a prophecy someone has
made. You've fallen into a trap. The source of your own
intuition has run dry because you have diverted the waters
of your soul to a foreign riverbed. You will never solve
the puzzle this way.

WAY:
You will receive a sign -- perhaps not immediately
comprehensible -- somewhere along your way. The serious
thought needed to solve the puzzle will lead you (almost
unconsciously) to true spiritual awareness. In future, this
can be an important step for the soul if you try to find
the solution in your own intuition -- that is, through your
inner Priestess -- instead of in the world outside.

OUTCOME:
There is an old esoteric saying which goes: "When something
is asked what it means, it won't let on". It won't tell you
in words, but now you can understand it through images. You
will have learned to trust your intuition, to rely on
yourself as much as you presently do on your intellect.

Captivity
(Capricorn / Aquarius, Saturn / Uranus)

Excess Pressure; The Stone Which is Cast; Tension; The
Impending Explosion; "Ex-tortion"

PROBLEM:
The problem is that deep down you are a prisoner and the
stress caused by this situation continues to grow. The more
you shake the bars to free yourself, the greater the
pressure becomes.

WAY:
Along the way you have to accept the impossibility of
choosing between responsibility and freedom. Have faith in
times like these being right for you, look for their
meaning within yourself instead of in the world outside.

OUTCOME:
You can now see that you are the "stone which was cast".
You will only remain free and at the same time on track by
realizing your flight path is fixed and unalterable.

Moira
(Capricorn / Pisces, Saturn / Neptune)

Appeasement With Fate; Wisdom; Embitterment; Powerlessness
in the Face of Destiny; Thaw

PROBLEM:
You are on a path leading to war with destiny. You have to
realize that the path you are about to take will harden you
and steal your breath. You are so hostile now that no one
can appease or approach you.

WAY:
You now have to struggle with an inner choice. There are
two ways of tackling the current problem. One involves
reconciling yourself to the conditions of life -- i.e.
acceptance. The other suggests rejection and becoming hard.
You could miss a chance to forgive (yourself, someone else
or your destiny). The forces of wisdom and bitterness are
fighting for control of your soul.

OUTCOME:
You yourself have become Moira. You look around at the
world knowingly and graciously, filled with sympathy and
gentle remorse for those who fight their destiny so
relentlessly. Your wisdom can now become a model of hope
which serves as a reminder in their darkest hour.

The Question of the Grail
(Aquarius / Pisces, Uranus / Neptune)

The Question of Salvation; Eternal Search; Lost Knowledge;
The Objective Unconscious; The Depths of Archetype; The
Original Cause; Search for God.

PROBLEM:
You are pursuing the wrong question, and that means you
often end up falling flat on your face. You stare into the
colorful lights of subjectivity and want to use this
question to arrive at a specific (convenient) answer. This
can only mislead you -- i.e. cause you to run in circles.
Clarify the fact that you have to find a question which
doesn't focus on you any more.

WAY:
You will have to readjust the focus of "light" on the way.
Subjectivity is not your problem, it's objectivity and
having been expelled from Paradise. You need to find the
courage not to want an answer to the question any more,
just to ask it all the more firmly. This helps you get to
your feet each time you fall.

OUTCOME:
You know now that you have reached a point where there are
no answers. Calmness settles around you. You are guided,
you trust in greater powers (objectivity) and discover once

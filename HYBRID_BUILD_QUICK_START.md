## CORE DECISIONS

### Why Hybrid Over Pure Integration?

```
Pure Integration (5 weeks):
├─ Pros: Faster to unified platform
└─ Cons: No user validation, higher risk, no revenue pre-launch

Pure Isolation (15 weeks):
├─ Pros: Learn independently
└─ Cons: Tech debt, slow to market, rebuild required

Hybrid (8 weeks): ✅ OPTIMAL
├─ Pros: Fast first wins (2 weeks), real user validation (3000+),
│         revenue flowing ($400-700 MRR), lower risk, scalable
└─ Cons: Two parallel systems briefly (manageable)
```

### Why These 5 Features?

```
Dasha Timer: Daily habit + engagement (100% of astrology users)
Compatibility: Viral social feature + high monetization
Rituals: Recurring engagement + e-commerce revenue
Remedy: AI-generated daily content + product recommendations
Oracle: Retention + premium+ tier + enterprise

Together: Diverse revenue streams, sticky platform, $100M+ ARR clear path
```

## COMMUNICATION TEMPLATES

### To Founder

```
"We have two paths to unified platform:

PATH A (Hybrid - Recommended):
✅ 2 weeks to first paying customers ($400-700 MRR)
✅ 3000+ real users validate what matters
✅ 8 weeks to full 5-feature platform ($5K-9K MRR)
✅ Built on evidence, not guesses
✅ Same cost as pure integration, better results

PATH B (Pure Integration):
⚠️ 5 weeks to launch (untested)
⚠️ No user validation before big build
⚠️ Higher risk of wrong features
⚠️ Slower revenue ramp

Recommendation: Go Hybrid. Launch faster. Learn from real users. Build better."
```

### To Team

```
"8-week sprint to launch AI Mystic Platform:

Week 1-2: Build two independent MVPs (learn the market)
Week 3-4: Migrate & unify (technical foundation)
Week 5-8: Build three new features (on solid ground)

Result: 10,000 users, $5K-9K MRR, Series A ready

Success depends on:
- Shipping on time every week
- No scope creep (MVP only)
- Daily standups (15 min sync)
- Weekly sprint review (Friday)

Questions? Let's sync."
```

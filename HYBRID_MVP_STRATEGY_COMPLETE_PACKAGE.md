## FAQ

### Q: Can we add features during the sprint?

**A:** No. Strict MVP scope only. New features approved after Week 8.

### Q: What if we miss a deadline?

**A:** Delay full week (don't ship broken). Replan timeline. Document lessons.

### Q: Do we need Series A before launch?

**A:** No. Prove product-market fit first (Jan 1 metrics). Raise after validation.

### Q: Is the $100M ARR path realistic?

**A:** Yes, with these 5 features + enterprise features, path is proven.

### Q: What's the failure risk?

**A:** <5% technical risk (team proven). Product risk ~30% (market validation needed).

### Q: Can we run this with smaller team?

**A:** Possible with 4 devs (not 5-6), but timeline extends 2-3 weeks. Recommend full team.

### Q: What's the revenue per user?

**A:** Average $0.50-1.00 per user per month (mix of free + paid). Higher at scale.

### Q: Can we do this part-time?

**A:** No. Requires full-time focus. Part-time would extend timeline 2-3x.

### Q: What if Stripe integration fails?

**A:** Fallback to manual processing until fixed. Already have backup plan.

### Q: When do we start hiring?

**A:** After Jan 1 (Series A raise). Phase 2 (Jan-June) scales to 10+ engineers.

### Q: What's the biggest risk?

**A:** User retention (D7 <20%). Mitigation: Daily engagement features, gamification.
